- **Notes** 1. Discharged using 10mA to 2.0V @ +23°C.
- 2. Operation at extreme ranges (temperature or current) may lead to reduced capacity and lower voltage readings at beginning of pulses. Consult with Ultralife.
- 3. For additional conditions please consult Ultralife.
- 4. For bulk shipments by air that are no more than eight cells and one package, this cell is Excepted Dangerous Goods and can be shipped under Packing Instruction 968, Section II.
