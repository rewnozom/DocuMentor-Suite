### Section 5 – Fire-Fighting Measures

In case of fire where lithium batteries are present, flood area with water or smother with a Class D fire extinguishant appropriate for lithium metal, such as lith-X. Water may not extinguish burning batteries but will cool the adjacent batteries and control the spread of fire. Burning batteries will burn themselves out. Virtually all fires involving lithium batteries can be controlled by flooding with water. However, the contents of the battery will react with water and form hydrogen gas. In a confined space, hydrogen gas can from an explosive mixture. In this situation, smothering agents are recommended. A smothering agent will extinguish burning lithium batteries.

Emergency Responders should wear self-contained breathing apparatus. Burning lithium manganese dioxide battery produce toxic and corrosive lithium hydroxide fumes.

## Section 7 – Handling and Storage

Store in a cool, well ventilated area. Elevated temperatures can result in shortened battery life. In locations that handle large quantities of lithium batteries, such as warehouse, lithium batteries should be isolated from unnecessary combustible.

Mechanical Containment: If potting or sealing the battery in an airtight or watertight container is required, consult your GP Batteries International Ltd representative for precautionary suggestions. Do not obstruct safety release vents on batteries, Encapsulation of batteries will not allow cell venting and can cause high pressure rupture.

Handling: Accidental short circuit for a few seconds will not seriously affect the battery. Prolonged short circuit will cause the battery to lose energy, generate significant heat and can cause the safety release vent to open. Source of short circuits include jumbled batteries in bulk containers, metal jewelry, metal covered tables or metal belts used for assembly of batteries into devices. Damaging a lithium battery may result in an internal short circuit.

The contents of an open battery, including a vented battery, when exposed to water, may result in a fire and/or explosion. Crushed or damaged batteries may result in a fire.

If soldering or welding to the battery is required, consult us for proper precaution to prevent seal damage or short circuit. Do not recharge.

Do not puncture or abuse.
