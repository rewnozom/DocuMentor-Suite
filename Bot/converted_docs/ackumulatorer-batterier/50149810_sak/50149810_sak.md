#### **SECTION 2: HAZARDS IDENTIFICATION**

#### **2.1 CLASSIFICATION OF THE SUBSTANCE OR MIXTURE**

#### **Emergency overview:**

The rechargeable Li-ion battery cells described in this Safety Data Sheet are sealed units which are not hazardous when used according to the recommendations of the manufacturer.

The product should not be disassembled. Do not short circuit, puncture, incinerate, crush, immerse in water, or expose to temperatures outside the by the manufacturer declared temperature range of the product. If this occurs, electrolyte leakage, or battery vent/explosion/fire may follow, depending on the circumstances.

#### **Routes of entry:**

Risk of exposure will only occur if the battery cell is mechanically, thermally, or electrically abused and the enclosure is compromised. If this occurs, exposure to electrolyte solutions contained within the battery cell may occur by inhalation, eye contact, skin contact and ingestion.

#### **Potential health effects:**

- **Eyes:** Contact between the battery and eye will not cause any harm. Eye contact with the contents of a ruptured battery can cause severe irritation to the eye.
- **Skin:** Contact between the battery and skin will not cause any harm. Skin contact with positive and negative terminals of high voltages may cause burns to the skin. Skin contact with a ruptured battery can cause skin irritation.
- **Inhalation:** Inhalation of material from a sealed battery is not an expected route of exposure. Vapours or mists from a ruptured battery may cause respiratory irritation.

#### **2.2 LABEL ELEMENTS**

The rechargeable Li-ion battery described in this Safety Data Sheet is marked with the symbols listed under section 15.
