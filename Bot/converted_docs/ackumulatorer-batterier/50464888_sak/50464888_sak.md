GP batteries are considered to be "Dry cell" batteries and are unregulated for purposes of transportation by the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT), International Civil Aviation Administration (ICAO), International Air Transport Association (IATA) 62nd edition Special Provision A123 and International Maritime Dangerous Goods Regulations (IMDG). The only DOT requirement for shipping these batteries is special provision 130 which states: "Batteries, dry are not subject to the requirements of this subchapter only when they are offered for transportation in a manner that prevents the dangerous evolution of heat (For example, by the effective insulation of exposed terminals). IATA requires that batteries being transported by air must be protected from short-circuiting and protected from movement that could lead to short-circuiting.
