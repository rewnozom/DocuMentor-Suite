### **Section 4 – First Aid Measures**

First Aid Procedures

If electrolyte leakage occurs and makes contact with skin, wash with plenty of water immediately.

If electrolyte comes into contact with eyes, wash with copious amounts of water for fifteen (15) minutes, and contact a physician.

If electrolyte vapors are inhaled, provide fresh air and seek medical attention if respiratory irritation develops. Ventilate the contaminated area.

Extinguishing Media Carbon Dioxide, Dry Chemical or Foam extinguishers Special Fire Fighting Procedures N.A. Unusual Fire and Explosion Hazards Do not dispose of battery in fire - may explode. Do not short-circuit battery - may cause burns. **Section 6 – Accidental Release Measures** Steps to Be Taken in Case Material is Released or Spilled Batteries that are leakage should be handled with rubber gloves. Avoid direct contact with electrolyte. Wear protective clothing and a positive pressure Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA). **Section 7 – Handling and Storage** Safe handling and storage advice Batteries should be handled and stored carefully to avoid short circuits. Do not store in disorderly fashion, or allow metal objects to be mixed with stored batteries. Never disassemble a battery. Do not breathe cell vapors or touch internal material with bare hands.

The cells and batteries shall not be stored in high temperature ,the maximum temperature allowed is 60℃ for a

short period during the shipment , Otherwise the cells maybe leakage and can result in shortened service life..

Health Hazard (Acute and Chronic) / Toxiclogical information In case of electrolyte leakage, skin will be itchy when contaminated with electrolyte.

In contact with electrolyte can cause severe irritation and chemical burns.

Inhalation of electrolyte vapors may cause irritation of the upper respiratory tract and lungs.

## **Section 12 – Ecological Information**

N.A.

## **Section 13 – Disposal Considerations**

Dispose of batteries according to government regulations.

### **Section 14 – Transportation Information**

In general, all batteries in all forms of transportation (ground, air, or ocean) must be packaged in a safe and responsible manner. Regulatory concerns from all agencies for safe packaging require that batteries be packaged in a manner that prevents short circuits and be contained in "strong outer packaging" that prevents spillage of contents. All original packaging for GP alkaline batteries has been designed to be compliant with these regulatory concerns.

Alkaline batteries (sometimes referred to as "Dry cell" batteries) are not listed as dangerous goods under the ADR European Agreement Concerning the International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road, the IMDG International Maritime Dangerous Goods Code, UN Dangerous Good Regulations, IATA Dangerous Goods Regulations 62 nd edition, ICAO Technical Instructions and the U.S. hazardous materials regulations (49 CFR). These batteries are not subject to the dangerous goods regulations provided they meet the requirements contained in the following special provisions

| . Regulatory Body | Special Provisions           |
|-------------------|------------------------------|
| ADR               | Not regulated                |
| IMDG              | Not regulated                |
| UN                | Not regulated                |
| US DOT            | 49 CFR 172.102 Provision 130 |
| IATA              | A123                         |
| ICAO              | Not regulated                |

All GP alkaline batteries are packed in such a way to prevent short circuits or the generation dangerous quantities of heat and meet the special provisions listed above. In addition, the IATA Dangerous Goods Regulations and ICAO Technical Instructions require the words "not restricted" and the Special Provision number A123 be provided on the air waybill, when an air waybill is issued.
