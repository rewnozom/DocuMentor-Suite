# Lithium Iron Phosphate (LiFePO4) Battery SPLi12-12 (12.8V, 12Ah)

E-number: 5233737

# Features of LiFePO4 Battery

◼ Longer Cycle Life: Offers up to 20 times longer cycle life and five times longer float/calendar life than lead acid battery, helping to minimize replacement cost and reduce total cost of ownership.

◼ Lighter Weight: About 40 % of the weight of a comparable lead acid battery. A 'drop in' replacement for lead acid batteries.

◼ Higher Power: Delivers twice the power of a lead acid battery, even high discharge rate, while maintaininghigh energy capacity.

◼ Wider Temperature Range: -20°C ~ 60°C

◼ Superior Safety: Lithium Iron Phosphate chemistry eliminates the risk of explosion or combustion due to high impact, overcharging or short circuit situation.

◼ Increased Flexibility: Modular design enables deployment of up to four batteries in series and up to ten batteries in parallell.
