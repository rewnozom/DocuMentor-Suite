# **BE IN CHARGE**

# **DATASHEET SUPER B EPSILON** SB12V1200WH-M

**The Epsilon is a drop-in lead-acid replacement, with all the benefits of Lithium Iron Phosphate. It has superior weight reduction, enormous energy reserves and stable voltage even at**  **extreme loads. This lithium battery is suitable for 12V installations. Eliminating the need for an external safety relay means the lithium battery is very easy to install.**

## **BATTERY MONITORING**

The Super B Epsilon has integrated battery monitoring which provides details about its status such as voltage, current, temperature, state of charge and time remaining. Hands-on monitoring is also possible via Bluetooth and LED indicators to inform you about the actual status of your battery. The free BeInCharge app provides 24/7 information about the state of charge, time to go and status of the battery.
