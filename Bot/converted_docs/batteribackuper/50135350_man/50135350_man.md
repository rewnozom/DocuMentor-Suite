## **Safety of persons**

- RISK OF VOLTAGE BACKFEED. The system has its own power source (the battery). Isolate the UPS and check for hazardous voltage upstream and downstream during lockout-tagout operation. Terminal blocks may be energized even if the system is disconnected from the AC power source.
- Dangerous voltage levels are present within the system. It should be opened exclusively by qualified service personnel.
- The system must be properly grounded.
- The battery supplied with the system contains small amounts of toxic materials. To avoid accidents, the directives listed below must be observed:
	- Servicing of batteries should be performed or supervised by personnel knowledgeable about batteries and the required precautions.
	- When replacing batteries, replace with the same type and number of batteries or battery packs.
	- Do not dispose of batteries in a fire. The batteries may explode.
	- Batteries constitute a danger (electrical shock, burns). The short-circuit current may be very high.
- Precautions must be taken for all handling:
	- Wear rubber gloves and boots.
	- Do not lay tools or metal parts on top of batteries.
	- Disconnect charging source prior to connecting or disconnecting battery terminals.
	- Determine if battery is inadvertently grounded. If inadvertently grounded, remove source from ground. Contact with any part of a grounded battery can result in electrical shock. The likelihood of such shock can be reduced if such grounds are removed during installation and maintenance (applicable to equipment and remote battery supplies not having a grounded supply circuit).

### **Product safety**

- The UPS connection instructions and operation described in the manual must be followed in the indicated order.
![](_page_5_Picture_0.jpeg)

- CAUTION To reduce the risk of fire, the unit connects only to a circuit provided with branch circuit overcurrent protection for :
63A rating, for 6kVA models,

100A rating, for 10kVA models

The upstream circuit breaker for Normal AC/Bypass AC must be easily accessible. The unit can be disconnected from AC power source by opening this circuit breaker.

- An additional AC contactor is used for backfeed protection and must comply with IEC/EN 62040-1 (the creep age and clearance distances shall meet the basic insulation requirements for pollution degree 2).
- Disconnection and overcurrent protection devices shall be provided by others for permanently connected AC input (Normal AC/Bypass AC) and AC output circuits.
- Check that the indications on the rating plate correspond to your AC powered system and to the actual electrical consumption of all the equipment to be connected to the system.
- For PLUGGABLE EQUIPMENT, the socket-outlet shall be installed near the equipment and shall be easily accessible
- Never install the system near liquids or in an excessively damp environment.
- Never let a foreign body penetrate inside the system.
- Never block the ventilation grates of the system.
- Never expose the system to direct sunlight or source of heat.
- If the system must be stored prior to installation, storage must be in a dry place.
- The admissible storage temperature range is -25°C to +60°C with battery(-15°C to +40°C without battery).

### **Special precautions**

- The unit is heavy: wear safety shoes and use vacuum lifter preferentially for handling operations.
- All handling operations will require at least two people (unpacking, lifting, installation in rack system).
- Straps are provided only for unpacking manually the unit from the carton; don't use the straps to carry the unit around. The unit can slip from the straps during handling (risk of injury and product damage):
	- keep 12in / 30cm minimum distance between the straps
	- lift the unit carefully and keep it at low height
- keep the unit horizontal during unpacking.
- Before and after the installation, if the UPS remains de-energized for a long period, the UPS must be energized for a period of 24 hours, at least once every 6 months (for a normal storage temperature less than 25°C). This charges the battery, thus avoiding possible irreversible damage.
- During the replacement of the Battery Module, it is imperative to use the same type and number of element as the original Battery Module provided with the UPS to maintain an identical level of performance and safety.

### **7. UPS maintenance**

#### **7.1 Equipment care**

For the best preventive maintenance, keep the area around the equipment clean and dust free. If the atmosphere is very dusty, clean the outside of the system with a vacuum cleaner.

For full battery life, keep the equipment at an ambient temperature of 25°C (77°F).

If the UPS requires any type of transportation, verify that the UPS is disconnected and turned off. The batteries are rated for a 3-5 year service life. The length of service life varies, depending on the frequency of usage and ambient temperature. Batteries used beyond expected service life will often have severely reduced runtimes. Replace batteries at least every 4 years to keep units running at peak efficiency.

#### **7.2 Transporting the UPS**

![](_page_45_Picture_10.jpeg)

The internal UPS batteries MUST be disconnected before transport.

The following procedure should be performed or supervised by personnel knowledgeable about batteries and the required precaution. Keep unauthorized personnel away from batteries.

If the UPS requires any type of transportation, the batteries must be disconnected (but not removed) before the unit is transported:

- 1. Verify that the UPS is off and disconnected from utility power.
- 2. Place the UPS on a flat, stable surface with the front of the cabinet facing you.
- 3. Remove the UPS front cover
- 4 .Disconnect the internal battery connectors
- 5. Replace the UPS front cover

#### **7.3 Storing the equipment**

If you store the equipment for a long period, recharge the battery every 6

months by connecting the UPS to utility power. The EBM charge to 90% capacity in less than 3 hours.

However, recommends that the batteries charge for 48 hours after long-term storage.

If the date has passed and the batteries were never recharged, do not use them. Contact your service representative.

#### **7.4 Replacing batteries**

![](_page_46_Picture_5.jpeg)

DO NOT DISCONNECT the batteries while the UPS is in Battery mode.

Consider all warnings, cautions, and notes before replacing batteries.

- Servicing should be performed by qualified service personnel with knowledgeable of batteries and required precautions. Keep unauthorized personnel away from batteries.
- Batteries can present a risk of electrical shock or burn from high short circuit current. Observe the following precautions:
	- 1. Remove watches, rings, or other metal objects,
	- 2. Use tools with insulated handles,
	- 3. Do not lay tools or metal parts on top of batteries,
	- 4. Wear rubber gloves and boots.
- When replacing batteries, replace with the same type and number of batteries or battery packs. Contact your service representative to order new batteries.
- Proper disposal of batteries is required. Refer to your local codes for disposal requirements.
- Never dispose of batteries in a fire. Batteries may explode when exposed to flame.
- Do not open or mutilate the battery or batteries. Released electrolyte is harmful to the skin and eyes and may be extremely toxic.
- Take care if the battery is inadvertently grounded. If grounded, remove source from ground. Contact with any part of a grounded battery may cause electrical shock.
- The likelihood of such shock can be reduced if such grounds are removed during installation and maintenance (applicable to equipment and remote battery supplies not having a grounded supply circuit).

The EBM is heavy. Lifting the cabinet into a rack requires two people at least. For Tower module, should turn the MBS to bypass and switch off the input and then replace the EBM(s).

For RT module, if PDU is connected with the UPS, should turn the MBS to bypass and switch off the input and then replace the EBM(s). If PDU is not connected with the UPS, should turn off the UPS and then replace the EBM.

#### **To replace the EBM(s):**

- 1. Unplug the EBM power cable from the UPS. If additional EBM(s) are installed, unplug the EBM power cable from each EBM.
- 2. Replace the EBM(s). See "Recycling the used equipment" refer to chapter 7.4 for proper disposal.

A small amount of arcing may occur when connecting the EBM to UPS. This is normal and will not harm personnel. Please connect the EBM cable to the UPS quickly and firmly.

- 3. Plug the EBM cable(s) into the battery connector(s).
- 4. Verify that the EBM connections are tight, and there are adequate bend radius and strain relief exist for each cable.

#### **Testing new batteries**

- 1. Charge the batteries for 48 hours.
- 2. By pressing on the menu of "Control".
- 3. Select Control then Single battery test.

The UPS can starts battery test only in line mode without active alarms.

During the battery test, the UPS transfers to Battery mode and discharges the batteries for 10 seconds. The front panel displays and the percentage of the test completed.

#### **7.5Recycling the used equipment**

Contact your local recycling or hazardous waste center for information on proper disposal of the used equipment.

![](_page_48_Picture_2.jpeg)

Do not dispose of the batteries in the fire. Which may cause battery explosion. The batteries must be rightly disposed according to local regulation.

Do not open or destroy the batteries. Escaping electrolyte can cause injury to the skin and eyes. It may be toxic.

![](_page_48_Picture_5.jpeg)

Do not discard the UPS or the UPS batteries in the trash. This product contains sealed, lead acid batteries and must be disposed of properly. For more information, contact your local recycling/ reuse or hazardous waste center.

Do not discard waste electrical or electronic equipment (WEEE) in the trash. For proper disposal, contact your local recycling/reuse or hazardous waste center.

### **8. Troubleshooting**

The UPS is designed for durable, automatic operation and also alert you whenever potential operating problems may occur. Usually the alarms shown by the control panel do not mean that the output power is affected. Instead, they are preventive alarms intended to alert the user.

- Events are silent status information that are recorded into the Event log. Example = "Battery charging".
- Alarms are recorded into the Event log and displayed on the LCD status screen with the logo blinking. Some alarms may be announced by a beep every 1 second. Example = "Battery low".
- Faults are announced by a continuous beep and red LED, recorded into the Event log. Example = Out. short circuit.

Use the following troubleshooting chart to determine the UPS alarm condition.

### **8.1 Typical alarms and faults**

To check the Event log:

- 1. By pressing on the menu of "Event log".
- 2. Scroll through the listed events or faults.
- 3. The following table describes typical conditions.

### **10 Glossary**

| Bypass AC source                   | Source supplying the bypass line. The equipment can be<br>transferred to the bypass line if an overload occurs on the<br>UPS<br>output,<br>for<br>maintenance<br>or<br>in<br>the<br>event<br>of<br>a<br>malfunction.                                  |
|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Frequency converter                | Operating mode used to convert the AC-power frequency<br>between the UPS input and output (50Hz -> 60Hz or 60Hz<br>-> 50Hz).                                                                                                                          |
| Low-battery warning                | This is a battery-voltage level indicating that battery power<br>is low and that the user must take action to prevent the<br>imminent break in the supply<br>of power to the load.                                                                    |
| Backup time                        | Time during which the load can be supplied by the UPS<br>operating on battery power.                                                                                                                                                                  |
| HE mode                            | Operating mode by which the load is supplied directly by<br>the AC source if it is within the tolerances defined by the<br>user. This mode reduces the consumption of electrical<br>power                                                             |
| Manual bypass                      | Rotary switch controlled by the user, used to connect the<br>loads directly to the AC source. Transfer of the load to the<br>manual<br>bypass<br>enables<br>UPS<br>maintenance<br>without<br>interrupting the supply of power to the connected loads. |
| Normal (double<br>conversion) mode | The normal UPS operating mode in which the AC source<br>supplies the UPS which in turn supplies the connected<br>loads (after electronic double conversion).                                                                                          |
| Normal AC source                   | Normal source of power for the UPS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Relay contacts                     | Contacts supplying information to the user in the form of<br>signals.                                                                                                                                                                                 |
