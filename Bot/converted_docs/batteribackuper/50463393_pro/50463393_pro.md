- 1 The maximum total output of the PS300 is 330W. If the output of the appliance's actual use surpasses that value, the Error Indicator on the smart screen will be displayed.
- 2 A compatible solar panel must be purchased separately and will be available from EZVIZ soon.
- 3 Based on test results from the EZVIZ Lab. After 1,000 full charge circles, the battery capacity will drop to around 80% of its original capacity.
- 4 When charging high-wattage devices or appliances via the AC outlet (as per instruction stated in the User Manual), the power station may operate at an increased noise level. This will be due to the operation of built-in cooling fans.
- 5 The PS300 can only properly charge small-to-medium devices/appliances that have a maximum output of less than 300W. The numbers of each device's charging efficiency is based on testing results under standard conditions and may vary during actual use due to environmental factors.
