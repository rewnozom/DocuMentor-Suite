## REACH DECLARATION

REACH Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 Information required by article 33

As you are aware the majority of Milleteknik AB:s products are covered by the European regulations for the Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH). We are also selling Electronic and Electrical (EE) products that are covered by the European directive for the Restriction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS). We are continuously monitoring our supply base for the use of hazardous substances listed on the European Chemical Agency's (ECHA) candidate list for Substances of Very High Concern (SVHC), and the 10 substances listed in RoHS II and III. The latest version of the REACH Candidate list of SVHC's can be found here: <https://echa.europa.eu/en/candidate-list-table>

Based on the recent data we have received from our suppliers and external verifications we can confirm that we comply with the latest European requirements for REACH Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006, RoHS Directive 2011/65/EU ( RoHS II) and (EU)2015/863 (RoHS III).

Products sold by Milleteknik AB where the concentrations of SVHC's listed in the candidate list exceed the maximum levels are registered in ECHA scip database and are listed in the table below.

Lead (Pb): Was added to the candidate list as a SVHC in order to minimize exposure to children between ages 3 and 36 months who exhibit "mouthing behavior". The majority of Milleteknik Products containing lead are exempted from the REACH directive since the installation and use of the products makes it difficult for children up to 3 years of age to reach or ingest the products. The products are therefore safe to use, and complies with the latest REACH directive.

Lead is also one of the restricted substances covered by RoHS II and III. The Milleteknik products where lead concentrations exceed the maximum levels are products that contain electronic components. These materials are exempted from RoHS directive in Annex III, 6(a), 6(b) and 6(c) due to the difficulty to find suitable alternative materials or manufacturing methods at this point in time. The products are therefore RoHS compliant.

Milleteknik AB committed to complying with existing and emerging environmental requirements, and strive to continuously reduce environmental impacts and to meet customer's needs.
