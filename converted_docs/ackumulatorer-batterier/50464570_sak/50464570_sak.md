#### **Section 2 – Hazards Identification**

This contains potassium hydroxide solution (KOH), and other combustible materials, all sealed in steel can. For this reason, improper handling of the battery could lead to distortion, leakage*, overheating, explosion and cause human injury or equipment trouble. Please strictly observe safety instructions. (*leakage is defined as an unintended escape of liquid from a battery.)

#### **Section 4 – First Aid Measures**

None unless internal materials exposure. If contents are leaked out, observe following instructions: Inhalation Fumes can cause respiratory irritation. Remove to fresh air and consult a physician.

- Skin Immediately flush skin with plenty of water. If itch or irritation by chemical burn persists, consult a physician.
- Eyes Immediately flush eye with plenty of water for at least 15 minutes. Consult a physician immediately
- Ingestion If swallowing a battery, consult a physician immediately.

If contents come into mouth, immediately rinse by plenty of water and consult a physician.

Unusual Fire and Explosion Hazards

Do not dispose of battery in fire - may explode.

Do not short-circuit battery - may cause burns.

#### **Section 6 – Accidental Release Measures**

Steps to Be Taken in Case Material is Released or Spilled

Batteries that are leakage should be handled with rubber gloves.

Avoid direct contact with electrolyte.

Wear protective clothing and a positive pressure Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA).

### **Section 7 – Handling and Storage**

Safe handling and storage advice

Batteries should be handled and stored carefully to avoid short circuits.

Do not store in disorderly fashion or allow metal objects to be mixed with stored batteries.

Never disassemble a battery.

Document Number: MAA100 Revision:30 Page 3 of 5

Do not breathe cell vapors or touch internal material with bare hands.

The cells and batteries shall not be stored in high temperature, the maximum temperature allowed is

60℃ for a short period during the shipment, Otherwise the cells maybe leakage and can result in shortened service life.

#### **Section 14 – Transportation Information**

In general, all batteries in all forms of transportation (ground, air, or ocean) must be packaged in a safe and responsible manner. Regulatory concerns from all agencies for safe packaging require that batteries be packaged in a manner that prevents short circuits and be contained in "strong outer packaging" that prevents spillage of contents. All original packaging for GP alkaline batteries has been designed to be compliant with these regulatory concerns.

Alkaline batteries (sometimes referred to as "Dry cell" batteries) are not listed as dangerous goods under the ADR European Agreement Concerning the International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road, the IMDG International Maritime Dangerous Goods Code, UN Dangerous Good Regulations, IATA Dangerous Goods Regulations 64 th edition, ICAO Technical Instructions and the U.S. hazardous materials regulations (49 CFR). These batteries are not subject to the dangerous goods regulations provided they meet the requirements contained in the following special provisions.

| . Regulatory Body | Special Provisions           |
|-------------------|------------------------------|
| ADR               | Not regulated                |
| IMDG              | Not regulated                |
| UN                | Not regulated                |
| US DOT            | 49 CFR 172.102 Provision 130 |
| IATA              | A123                         |
| ICAO              | Not regulated                |

All GP alkaline batteries are packed in such a way to prevent short circuits or the generation of dangerous quantities of heat and meet the special provisions listed above. In addition, the 2023 IATA Dangerous Goods Regulations and ICAO Technical Instructions require the words "not restricted" and the Special Provision number A123 be provided on the air waybill, when an air waybill is issued.

#### **Section 15 – Regulatory Information**

Special requirements according to local regulations.

#### **Section 16 – Other Information**

The data in this Material Safety Data Sheet relates only to the specific material designated herein.

#### **Section 17 – Measures for fire extinction**

In case of fire, it is permissible to use any class of extinguishing medium on these batteries or their packing material. Cool exterior of batteries if exposed to fire to prevent rupture.

Fire fighters should wear self-contained breathing apparatus.
