### **SECTION 7: CARCINOGENICITY**

#### **Carcinogenicity**

Sulfuric Acid: The National Toxicological Program (NTP) and The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) have classified strong inorganic acid mist containing sulfuric acid as a Category 1 carcinogen, a substance that is carcinogenic to humans. The ACGIH has classified strong inorganic acid mist containing sulfuric acid as an A2 carcinogen (suspected human carcinogen). These classifications do not apply to liquid forms of sulfuric acid or sulfuric acid solutions contained within a battery. Inorganic acid mist (sulfuric acid mist) is not generated under normal use of this product. Misuse of the product, such as overcharging, may result in the generation of sulfuric acid mist.

Lead Compounds: Human studies are inconclusive regarding lead exposure and an increased cancer risk. The EPA and the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) have categorized lead and inorganic lead compounds as a B2 classification (probable/possible human carcinogen) based on sufficient animal evidence and inadequate human evidence.

### **SECTION 8: PRECAUTIONS FOR SAFE HANDLING AND USE**

#### **Spill or Leak Procedures**

In case the release occurs, stop flow of material: contain/absorb small spills with dry sand, earth, and vermiculite. If possible, carefully neutralize spilled electrolyte with soda ash, sodium bicarbonate, lime, etc. Wear acid-resistant clothing, boots, gloves, and face shield. Do not allow discharge of unneutralized acid to sewer.

#### **Waste Disposal Method**

Spent Batteries - send to secondary lead smelter for recycling. Follow applicable federal, state and local regulations Neutralize as in preceding step. Collect neutralized material in sealed container and handle as hazardous waste as applicable. A copy of this MSDS must be supplied to any scrap dealer or secondary lead smelter with the battery. Or, consult state environment agency and/ or federal EPA.

#### **Handling and Storing**

Store batteries in a cool, dry, well ventilated area that are separated from incompatible materials and any activities which may generate flames, sparks, or heat. Keep all metallic articles that could contact the negative and positive terminals on a battery and create a short circuit condition. Battery should be stored under roof for protection against adverse weather conditions. Store and handle only in areas wit adequate water supply and spill control. Avoid damage to battery case.

#### **Electrical Safety**

Due to the battery's low internal resistance and high power density, high levels of short circuit current can be developed across the battery terminals. Do not rest tools or cables on the battery. Use insulated tools only. Follow all installation instructions and diagrams when installing or maintaining battery systems.
