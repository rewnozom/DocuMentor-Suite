## SECTION 5: FIRE-FIGHTING MEASURES

### Extinguishing Media

Dry chemical, foam, CO2

### Firefighting

Use positive pressure, self-contained breathing apparatus. Beware of acid splatter during water application and wear acid-resistant clothing, gloves, face and eye protection. If batteries are on charge, shut off power to the charging equipment, but, note that strings series connected batteries. May still pose risk of electric shock even when charging equipment is shut down. In operation, batteries generate and release flammable hydrogen gas. If ignited by burning cigarette, naked flame e.g. spark, may cause battery explosion with dispersion of casing fragments and corrosive liquid electrolyte. Carefully follow manufacturer`s instructions for installation and service. Keep away all sources of gas ignition and do net allow metallic articles to simultaneously contact the negative and positive terminals of a battery.

## SECTION 6: ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES

### Steps to be Taken in case Material is Released or Spilled

If the battery is accidently broken and organic electrolyte leaks out, wipe it up with a cloth, and dispose of it in a plastic bag and put into a steel can.

The preferred response is to leave the area and allow the batteries to cool and vapors to dissipate. Provide maximum ventilation. Avoid skin and eye contact or inhalation of vapors.

Remove spilled liquid with absorbent and incinerate.

### Special File Fighting Procedures:

If batteries are on charge, turn off power. Use positive pressure, self-contained breathing apparatus in fighting fire. Water applied to electrolyte generates heat and causes it to splatter. Wear acid resistant clothing. Ventilate area well.

### Unusual fire and Explosion Hazards:

Hydrogen and oxygen gases are generated in cells during normal battery operation or when on charge. (Hydrogen is flammable and oxygen supports combustion). These gases enter the vent caps during battery overcharging. To avoid risk of fire or explosion, keep sparks and other sources of ignition away form the battery. Do not allow metal objects to simultaneously contact both positive and negative terminal of batteries. Ventilate area well.

SEALED MAINTENANCE-FREE NON-SPILLABLE

## Waste Disposal Method

It is recommended to discharge the battery to the end, to use up the metal lead inside the battery. And bury the discharged battery in soil.

## SECTION7: HANDING AND STORAGE

The batteries should not be opened, destroyed or incinerate, since they may leak or rupture and release to the environment the ingredients that they contain in the hermetically sealed container.

### Precautions to be taken in handing and storing

Avoid mechanical or electrical abuse. Storage preferably in cool, dry and ventilated area, which is subject to little temperature charge. Strorage at high temperatures should be avoided. Do not place the battery near heating equipment, nor expose to direct sunlight for long periods.

## SECTION 8: EXPOSURE CONTROLS, PERSONAL PROTECTION

### Engineering Controls

Store and handle in well- ventilated area。If mechanical ventilation is used, components must be acid-resistant.

### Work Practices

Handle batteries cautiously. Avoid bodily contact with internal components.

Wear protective clothing, eye and face protection, when filling or handling batteries.

### Respiratory protection

None required under normal conditions. When concentration of sulphuric acid mist are known to exceed PEL, use NIOSH or MSHA-approved respiratory protection.

### Protective Gloves

Rubber or plastic acid-resistant gloves.

Eye Protection

Chemical goggles or face shield.

Body Protection

Protective Clothing.

SEALED MAINTENANCE-FREE NON-SPILLABLE

Avoid contact with strong acids, bases, haliders, halogenates, potassium nitrate and reducing agents.

### Hazardous Decomposition products

Electrolyte: Sulfur trioxide, carbon monoxide, sulfuric acid mist, sulfur dioxide, hydrogen sulfide.

Lead dioxide and lead: Temperatures above the melting point are likely to produce toxic metal fume, vapor or dust.

## SECTION 11: TOXICOLOGICAL INFORMATION

**LEAD:** The toxic effects of lead are accumulative and slow to appear. It affects the kidneys, reproductive, and central nervous system.

The symptoms of lead overexposure are anemia, vomiting, headache, stomach pain (lead colic), dizziness, loss of appetite, and muscle and joint pain. Exposure to lead from a battery most often occurs during lead reclaim operations through the breathing or ingestion of lead dusts and fumes.

#### **THIS DATA MUST BE PASSED TO ANY SCRAP OR SMELTER WHEN A BATTERY IS RESOLD.**

**SULFURIC ACID:** Sulfuric acid is a strong corrosive. Contact with acid can cause severe burns on the skin and in the eyes. Ingestion of sulfuric acid will cause GI tract burns. Acid can be release if the battery case is damaged or if the vents are tampered with.

**FIBERGLASS SEPARATOR:** Fibrous glass is an irritant of the upper respiratory tract, skin and eyes. For exposure up to 10F/CC use MSA Comfort with type H filter. Above 10F/CC up to 50F/CC use Ultra-Twin with type H filter. NTP or OSHA does not consider this product carcinogenic.

## SECTION 12: ECOLOGICAL INFORMATION

- 1. Store lead/acid batteries with adequate ventilation. Room ventilation is required for batteries utilized for standby power generation. Never recharge batteries in an unventilated, enclosed space.
- 2. Do not remove vent caps. Follow shipping and handling instructions that are applicable to the battery type. To avoid damage to terminals and seals, do not double-stack industrial batteries.

### Steps to be taken in case of leaks or spills

If sulfuric acid is spilled from a battery, neutralize the acid with sodium bicarbonate (baking soda), sodium carbon (soda ash), or calcium oxide (lime). Flush the area with water discard to the sewage systems. Do not allow unneutralized acid into the sewage system.

plates. The electrolyte in the AGM Series battery is held captive in an Absorbent Glass Mat (AGM) separator between the plates that immobilizes the electrolyte in the cell. AGM separator material is a highly porous, absorbent micro fiberglass mat mixed with polymer fibers. There is NO" free" electrolyte to leak out if the cell is tipped over (cell case and cover are sealed together) or if the cell is punctured. The AGM separator material immobilizes immobilizes the electrolyte and creates a situation where a spill of electrolyte is highly unlikely. Typical accidents where a VRLA battery case is punctured result in a slight drip or a slow ooze of material out of the cell that cannot be characterized as a spill.

**NOTE**: XLENT VRLA batteries do NOT contain a gel electrolyte. During normal battery installation, operation and maintenance, the user has NO contact with the internal components of the battery or its internal hazardous chemicals.
