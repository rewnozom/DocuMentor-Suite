# UC240

**UltraSync Communicator with IP and 4G/2G dual path suitable for both fire and intrusion panels**

#### **Overview**

UC240 UltraSync Communicator is a dual path alarm signalling unit for transmitting alarm signals from a customer's alarm panel to a Central Monitoring Stations (CMS). The monitoring path is based on IP and SIM 4G/2G mobile technology. The unit is designed for use in both security and fire systems.

• Dual-path monitoring for low, medium and high risk sites, covering intruder applications, fire and more.

• These monitored alarm signalling devices are small enough to fit inside most alarm panels. They use two signalling paths – if the primary path is down, the secondary path kicks in. And if that happens, the secondary path will use the primary path reporting and polling times.

• The primary path uses IP technology to send alarm signals over the customer's network or broadband hub.

• The secondary path uses 4G or 2G mobile connectivity – with dual SIMs for extra resilience.

### **Alarm panel interfaces**

• 16 general purpose alarm inputs (Logic High = +2V to +30V/Logic Low = <1.3V)

- 3 relay outputs
- Unconnected state: Logic Low
- Standard screw terminals
- Programmable function output-for remote control of site devices
- Line fault output-for status indication at site of alarm signalling path
- Dial Capture with phone line simulation
- Onboard RS232 or RS485 for direct panel interface to some panels

#### **Dial Capture features**

- Converts dialler alarm systems into high security signalling devices
- Alarm panel interface supports: Ademco Contact ID, Ademco Hi Speed, Ademco 4+1, Ademco 4+2, SIA 1/2/3

#### **Configuration**

- Simple single push button pin learn
- iOS and Android installer app
- Using on board menu driven by push buttons
