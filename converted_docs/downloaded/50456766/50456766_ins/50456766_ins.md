### **Description**

UC140/UC240 UltraSync Communicator is an alarm signalling unit for transmitting alarm signals from a customer's alarm panel to a Central Station (CS).

- UC140 is a single path signalling unit with the cellular 4G/2G communication. It is designed only for intrusion systems.
- UC240 is a dual path signalling unit, with the primary IP path and the cellular 4G/2G communication as the backup path. The UC240 is designed for use in both intrusion and fire alarm systems.

The unit communicates via UltraSync, and a valid UltraSync account must exist for the unit to communicate. The UltraSync account will have been populated with the serial number of the unit.

The communicator has 8 or 16 general purpose alarm inputs, and 2 or 3 outputs (depending on the variant), making it suitable for connection to most common alarm panels.

### **Mounting and wiring**

#### **Removal of cover**

The top cover can be removed by gently releasing each of the 4 clips on the base of the unit by pushing the clips outward with a screwdriver blade. Regular access to the inside of the unit should not be required, although occasional access may be required to access the SIM card.

#### **Mounting**

The unit should be mounted inside a suitable robust enclosure, using the sticky mounting pads supplied.

For security installations the enclosure must meet or exceed the protection requirements of the particular security grade for the whole installation as per EN 50131-1.

For fire alarm panels the enclosure must meet the requirements of EN 54-21 7.3 (for example, IP30 or above). Enclosure requirements for the signalling unit are the same as for the fire alarm panel itself and must meet EN 54-2 and EN 54-21. The enclosure must restrict access to installer level 3. The enclosure must provide the facility to indicate the state of the fault and acknowledge outputs on the signalling unit. If the fire panel and the separate enclosure are some distance apart (i.e. not within line of sight) then the indications should be at the panel.

**Caution:** Mounting the signalling unit within fire alarm panel or fire alarm power supply enclosure might invalidate their compliance with EMC regulatory requirements.

The supplied aerial should be mounted vertically outside of the housing by removing the adhesive backing. The aerial must not be affixed to a metal surface such as the alarm panel enclosure as this can significantly degrade the EMC performance of the system.

The supplied aerial should be mounted vertically outside of the housing by removing the adhesive backing.

#### **Connection terminals**

The screw terminals for the alarm inputs are suitable for use with a standard 3 mm blade terminal screwdriver.

See Figure 1 for connections.

#### **Power connection**

See Figure 1, item 13.

The unit is designed to be connected to the auxiliary power output on an associated alarm panel, or separate powered enclosure. For use with intruder alarm panels the power supply must meet the requirements of EN 50131-6.

For use with Fire alarm panels the power supply must meet the requirements of EN 54-4 and the unit must be mounted in the same enclosure as the power supply from which it derives its power. Ensure the power source is sufficient to power all devices connected. See "Specifications" on page 14 for more information. The account at the Central Station (CS) should be put "on test" before power up, as signals will be sent following initialisation.

### **Alarm inputs**

#### See Figure 1, item 12.

Of the 16 alarm pin inputs, all behave as general purposes inputs with the following exceptions.

Pin 1 must be used for Fire alarm when ACK NAK outputs are used for Fire panels. The signalling unit, when configured, provides an acknowledge and not acknowledged indication via use of outputs 2 (Func) and 3 (Fire).

Pin 4 can have an RPS output associated with it. See "Output 2 (Func)" on page 5, RPS (not available for Fire configuration).

Pin 11 acts as an ATS input as per the requirements of the BSIA form 175 document. This applies only when output 1 is set to BSIA mode (not available when configured for Fire).

Pin 13 acts as an AC fail input and therefore has a default 7 minute delay before a pin 13 alarm is transmitted. It also has a 7-minute delay before a reset is sent. On presenting an alarm condition to pin 13, the units display will show the alarm immediately but 7 minutes of constant alarm condition needs to elapse before transmission. Similarly, restoring pin 13 will immediately remove pin 13 from the display, but 7 minutes of constant restore condition needs to elapse before transmission of pin 13 restore.

The 7-minute time delay can be configured through the web portal or app by typing a new value up to 99 (minutes) in the "Mains Fail delay" field. If the "Mains Fail delay" is set to 0, then pin 13 can be used as a general purpose alarm input (subject to CS acceptance).

#### **Interconnection monitoring**

Pins 1 to 16 can be set up for End of Line and Dual End of Line interconnection monitoring. The following modes are available:

- None: Alarm and Restore detection.
- EOL (Single End of Line mode): Alarm, Restore and Cut detection. See Figure 5, EOL, for connection diagram.
- DEOL (Dual End of Line mode): Alarm, Restore, Cut and Short detection. See Figure 5, DEOL, for connection diagram.

**Figure 5: Input connection diagram**

- (1) To 12V or 24V supply
- (4) To alarm input (pin) (5) EOL 2, 3.3 kΩ resistor
- (2) EOL, 10 kΩ resistor (3) Normally open contact

The typical panel connections for panel with 2 inputs and unit with interconnection monitoring is shown in Figure 2. For this example, you need to configure inputs as following.

Ensure that the required pins have Dual EOL enabled in the configuration menu in the example pin 1 and pin 8 have been enabled for this.

- Output 1 = Single path fail
- Output 2 = Fire Nak
- Output 3 = Fire Ack (UC240 only)

#### **Default input configuration**

By default the, alarm inputs require a positive condition to be presented to send an alarm (default = positive applied). This can be changed using the Pin Learn button or through the configuration menu.

The default configuration is the following:

| UC140  | UC240    | Description                                                                                |
|--------|----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| —      | 1        | Fire alarm. When programed Fire NAK and<br>ACK outputs operate in conjunction with pin 1.  |
| —      | 2        | Fire Fault or Hold up alarm.                                                               |
| 1      | 3        | Intruder alarm.                                                                            |
| 2      | 4        | Open / Close (Set / Unset). Func output can be<br>set up as RPS in conjunction with pin 4. |
| 3 to 4 | 5 to 10  | General alarm.                                                                             |
| —      | 11       | ATS input (BSIA F175 mode). Can be<br>reprogrammed as a normal alarm pin.                  |
| —      | 13       | AC Fail alarm. Has a 7 minute delay which can<br>be altered in programming.                |
| 7 to 8 | 14 to 16 | General alarm.                                                                             |

### **Outputs**

Relay outputs are provided on screw terminals at the top of the unit (see Figure 1, item 2).

Output 1 is Comms, output 2 is Func, and output 3 is Fire (UC240 only).

For fire alarm installations the indication of 'acknowledgement of fire alarm' and 'SPT fault' messages must be provided by the fire panel into which the SPT is mounted. System fault indications which are notified by the line fault output (output 1) must be latched by the fire panel as required by EN 54-21.

#### **Default output configuration**

**Note:** Default settings provide simple installations for PD6669 without reprograming.

#### **Output 1 (Comms)**

Output 1 acts as the Communications fail output. The mode of operation can be selected through the configuration menu (see "Outputs menu" on page 7.

- 1: BSIA form 175 output (default setting). This allows the alarm panel to interrogate path faults as single path or dual path. By default the relay output will switch, following either path fail, once the relevant timer has expired (UC240 only).
If ATS input (pin 11) is toggled during the fail period, i.e. (panel interrogation) then Output 1 will either switch back to indicate a single path failure, or remain operated to indicate a dual path failure.

The unit also supports inverted mode BSIA175 operation by learning pin 11 to be positive removed.

- 2: Single path fault. Will operate when either path is in fault.
- 3: Dual path fault. The relay will operate when both the IP and Mobile path are in fault (only available in UC240).
- 4: IP Path fault. To be used in conjunction with Output 2 for the mobile path (only available in UC240). See "Output 2 (Func)" below.

#### **Output 2 (Func)**

Output 2 has a number of configuration options:

- 1: Dual path fault (default setting). Will operate when both paths are in fault (only available in UC240).
- 2: User control output. This can be switched on and off from the web portal or the app.
- 3: Mobile path fault output. In this case Output 1 is set as the IP path fault output, and Output 2 as the Mobile path fault output (only available in UC240).
- 4: RPS output for Pin 4. The output will operate when input pin 4 is triggered. It will return to normal when an acknowledge signal is returned from the CS. The output has a minimum operation time of 1 s.

When the acknowledgement is received in less than 1 second after pin 4 is triggered then the output will remain operational for 1 s.

- 5: Fire NAK output. When configured in this way Output 2 will activate after a pin 1 alarm is sent and no acknowledgement from the platform is received for 80 s (only available in UC240).
#### **Output 3 (UC240 only)**

- 1: User operated (default setting). This can be operated by the web portal or the application.
- 2: Fire ACK output. When configured in this way, output 3 will activate when an acknowledgment to a pin 1 alarm is received. It will deactivate when pin 1 resets.

#### **Fire output settings**

To ensure that the communicator can inform the fire alarm panel of status as per the requirements of EN 54, the outputs need to be configured as follows.

- Output 1: Comms. Single Path fail. Will operate when either signalling path fails.
- Output 2: FUNC. Fire Nak. Will operate after a pin 1 alarm is sent and no acknowledgement from the Central Station (CS) is received for 80 s.
- Output 3 (UC240 only): FIRE. Fire Ack. Will operate when an acknowledgment to a pin 1 alarm is received from the CS. It will return to normal when pin 1 is reset.

Output 1 will be operated in the normal state. This ensures that, in the unlikely event of a total failure of the unit, the fire panel will still detect a state change on its fault input.

The NAK and ACK relay operate in the following mode:

**Condition**

**Relay Terminal Fire ACK**

| Condition                   |                |           |
|-----------------------------|----------------|-----------|
| Power Off                   | Output 3       | C <-> NC  |
| Not in ACK (idle)           | Output 3       | C <-> NO  |
| ACK                         | Output 3       | C <-> NC  |
|                             | Relay Terminal | Fire NACK |
| Power Off                   | Output 2       | C <-> NC  |
| Not in NAK (idle)           | Output 2       | C <-> NO  |
| NAK (no ack for 80 seconds) | Output 2       | C <-> NC  |

### **Basic Arm/Disarm Wiring**

UC140/UC240 can be used to:

- Remotely arm a panel through keyswitch control
- Check alarm panel status

See Figure 4 for a wiring diagram example.

An operator or user can remotely control output 2 (Func), causing it to be active or passive (for example, to arm the panel). The output must be configured for user control output. See "Output 2 (Func)" above for details.

The panel can short input 2 (UC140) or input 4 (US240) to ground to indicate change of state (for example, armed or disarmed). The indicated state is configured by the operator.

### **Dial capture**

See Figure 1, item 1.

The dial capture (Dial Cap) terminals enable interfacing with an alarm panel digital communicator. The alarm panel can then send SIA, CID or Fast Format messages through the unit to the Central Station.

The dial capture pins present a 'phone line' to the panels on board digital communicator.

Connect the alarm panel's digital communicator line connections to the terminals marked Dial Cap on the unit. The terminals are not polarity conscious.

The dial capture board will auto detect the panel protocol as events are sent from the alarm panel. SIA, CID or FF.

If there are any issues you can easily spot them by connecting a test phone, or listening device to the Dial Capture inputs. The dial capture pins with a test phone connected and line seized (as if making a phone call) will provide a continuous tone (dialling tone). The dial capture pins will also have a voltage of 45 V.

Dial capture can also be used for upload download UDL allowing remote access with some types of alarm panel.

### **Serial Connection**

See Figure 1, item 4.

The serial data connection labelled TX, RX, B and A is configurable for RS485 or RS232 connection depending on the panel. This is done in the configuration menu. These ports allow serial alarm panel connection.

It is recommended that good quality screened cable (Belden type, CAT5e or equivalent) is used in all wiring of this type to avoid interference on the panel's data bus. Depending on the panel type, additional termination resistor may be required.

Please contact your Carrier representative for the latest information on panel compatibility for Upload Download and enhanced format signalling via serial connections.

### **Aerial connection**

#### See Figure 1, item 5.

Connect the supplied aerial to the MMCX connector on the top right of the unit. The aerial should be placed in a vertical position that receives the best wireless coverage. Carry out a survey to establish the best location. See also "Signal strength" below.

### **Programming**

The unit is supplied pre-configured with factory default values. For most installations no changes to the configuration are required.

The unit can either be configured by using the on-board configuration menu driven by the buttons, or through the UltraSync+ application, web server, or UltraSync Portal. Some configurations are only available through the application or the UltraSync Portal.

#### **Pin learn**

For speed of installation a single button press pin learn is available.

When ready press and hold the Down button (Figure 1, item 7) for 3 s, "Notice- Done!" is displayed when finished.

#### **Unit initialisation**

The unit will immediately attempt to connect to the UltraSync platform over the configured paths. See "Specifications" on page 14 for power up time.

#### **Status display**

The unit clearly displays its status on the OLED.

In its normal working state, the unit will cycle its display.

The alarm inputs (pins) can be set to the following modes:

- None: Alarm and Restore.
- EOL (Single End of Line mode): Alarm, Restore and Cut
- DEOL (Dual End of Line mode): Alarm, Restore, Cut and Short.

### **Outputs menu**

The three relay out puts can be configured as follows:

- 1. Output type 1 (Comms)
- BSIA 175 Mode: Operates when either path is in fault but in conjunction with Pin 11 ATS allows the panel to interrogate the device to determine a single or dual path fault (default)

- Single path fault: Operates when either path is in fault - Dual path fault: Operates when both paths are in fault (only available in UC240)

- IP path fault: Operates when the IP Path is in fault (only available in UC240)

- 2. Output type 2 (Func)
- Dual path fault: Operates when both paths are in fault (default) (only available in UC240)

- User: Allow the relay to be operated remotely via the app or portal (default)

- Mobile path fault: Operates when the mobile path is in fault

- RPS: Return path signal operates in conjunction with pin 4

- Fire Nak: Fire pin not acknowledged. Operates in conjunction with Pin 1

- 3. Output type 3 (Fire) (only available in UC240):
- User: Allow the relay to be operated remotely via the app or portal

- Fire Ack: Fire pin acknowledged. Operates in conjunction with Pin 1 (default)

### **Network menu**

The programing options under the network sub menu are:

- DHCP: Allows the unit to be changed between dynamic (DHCP client) or Static mode. Default setting is dynamic (DHCP enabled).
The Ethernet port will attempt to obtain an IP address from a DHCP server on the LAN.

- IP address: Shows current IP address but can also be configured for a static IP address
- Subnet mask address: Shows current subnet address but can also be configured for a customer subnet address
- Gateway address: Shows current gateway address but can also be configured for a customer gateway address
- DNS Address 1, DNS Address 2: Can be configured to use specific DNS servers
- Tunnel Port: 443 (default) or 10443
- Web passcode: Used in conjunction with Installer and Customer apps

#### **Static IP Address, Subnet mask and Gateway address**

If the unit is to be connected to a LAN that requires the unit to have a static IP address (i.e. no DHCP server on the LAN) then this can be configured as follows after setting DHCP to Disabled.

- 1. Go to Network > ETH IP Addr menu, and press Enter to edit.
ETH IP Addr * 000.000.000.000

- 2. Press Up and Down button until the correct number is selected.
- 3. Press Enter button to save the digit and move to the next one.
- 4. Repeat for all digits.
- 5. Press and hold Enter to save.
- 6. Repeat for Network > ETH Subnet Addr and Network > ETH GW Addr.

#### **DNS Addr 1**

Required to convert host names that are used to contact the server.

#### **DNS Addr 2**

Alternative DNS addresses, for example, 8.8.8.8 or 1.1.1.1.

#### **Tunnel Port**

The alternative tunnel port can be selected by accessing the Tunnel Port menu under network

- 443 (default)
- 10443

When used in IP mode, the unit will attempt to establish a connection to the UltraSync servers by signalling on IP Port 443. For most LANs this will function correctly, but on some advanced LAN configurations the network manager may not allow outgoing access on port 443 but 10443 may have outgoing access. Where this is the case then the unit can be configured to use the alternative port 10443. The UltraSync servers are set to accept both ports and so no changes are required other than on the unit's configuration.

#### **Web Passcode**

This code is used to set up both the installer and customer app, it can be changed from its default.

### **Diagnostics menu**

#### **Web server (only available in UC240)**

To allow access to program the unit via a laptop, the web server needs to be set to Enabled. Access to the web server is then allowed.

See also "Web Server" below.

### **Restore defaults menu**

The Restore defaults option on the menu can be used to set the unit back to factory default.

### **Web Server**

You need to plug in your laptop and login to the device.

Open your web browser and surf to http://192.168.222.222.

The default user is *installer*, and the default password is *9713*.

The unit has a static IP address of 192.168.222.222 for the duration that the web console is enabled. To access the Web Server a PC and device needs to be connected to the same LAN network. If an Ethernet switch is used to allow connectivity between device and a laptop, then the units will still be able to communicate with the platform over the IP path.

If you plug the cable direct from the PC to the unit, the unit will be unable to communicate across the IP path. A comms fault on the IP path will therefore be signalled to CS after the normal time out (normally 3 minutes for DP3, 30 mins for DP2). The Comms output will also operate after the time out (normally 4/30 mins) indicating single path fail. This is considered normal. The Mobile path will still function while the web server is enabled i.e. the unit respond to incoming polls over mobile.

- Web Server will automatically exit after 20 minutes.
- Web Server can be disabled at any time by the installer.
- Web server will revert to disabled if the unit is restarted.
- To access the Web Server a PC needs to be connected to the Ethernet port.
- Configure the PC to have a static IP address within the range 192.168.222.xxx.

For example, set the PC to have the following static details:

- IP address 192.168.222.10
- Subnet mask 255.255.255.0
- Gateway 192.168.222.222.

The status page shows the User operated outputs. Output 2 (Func), which can be renamed in the settings menu, can be operated by clicking on the interactive icon if output 2 (FUNC) is set up as USER. When operated, the interactive icon turns orange from blue, and back to blue when pressed again. Output 3 (Fire) can be operated in the same way when Output 3 (Fire) is set to USER. If the Output Icon is grey it means that the Output is not set up as User operated.

In the example above Output 2 is not configured to be user operated. Output 3 is configured.

#### **Status**

These icons show the status of the signalling paths and if there are any outstanding alarms. Green for the signalling path icons indicates signalling paths are successfully connected to the platform. Red indicates that a path is down.

In the example above LAN is red, (showing down), as we have connected the laptop into the Ethernet port – therefore the connection to the customers network is unplugged and the IP connection is in the down state.

The bell icon is Red in the example above as we have a Pin 4 alarm, shown in the system messages box, which you would expect to see as the system will be open.

If no pin inputs are in alarm the bell icon will be green.

#### **System messages**

The system messages box will scroll though the key messages:

- Battery: Will indicate if supply is low.
- Alarms GPI cut or short: Any pin inputs that are in the cut or short state (EOL or DEOL).
- Alarms GPI: Any pin inputs in alarm.
- Signal strength: Signal strength in dBm and the name of the mobile network operator. See also "Signal strength" on page 6.

The menu bar on the left hand side can take you to any of the menu options described below.

Should you need to make any changes in the following menu options click on save. This will save your changes to the unit.

#### **Pins menu**

![](_page_8_Picture_9.jpeg)

Pins shows the Name (if changed) and status of each of the pin alarms. OK with green dot shows the pin is not in alarm and Alarm with the red dot if in alarm. It will also show if a pin is in a cut or short state, with a blue dot and cut or short.

#### **Settings: GPIO**

![](_page_9_Figure_3.jpeg)

In this menu, by using the drop down buttons on each section, you can change any of the pin input status from High (positive removed) to Low (positive removed). You can set up either end of line (EOL) or dual end of line (DEOL) for each pin as required. Mains fail time for pin 13 can be adjusted. If set to Zero, pin 13 becomes a normal alarm pin. Each of the 3 outputs can be configured as described earlier in this guide.

In the example below, we show pin 8 as Active High, with DEOL monitoring. Output 2 is set to operate as a Fire NAK output (operates if an acknowledgement on a pin 1 alarm is not received within 80 seconds).

| Inputs 1-16 cut alarm    | n/a     | 325 (901-16)  |
| Inputs 1-16 Short Alarm  | n/a     | 324 (901-16)  |
| IP Path                  | 1023    | 351 (999)     |
| Mobile Path              | 1022    | 351 (998)     |
| Total Comms Fault        | n/a     | 350 ( 999)    |

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** If intending to use dial capture or serial for sending alarms, please confirm beforehand with your CS that their automation software is capable of differentiating correctly between pin alarms (UltraSync Platform generated alarms) and alarm panel generated zone alarms.

### **IP Specifications (only available in UC240)**

#### **Data usage / requirements**

IP polling is every 30 seconds. A poll and response results in 288 total bytes transferred (including IP headers). A small number of alarms will also typically be generated per day and these result in 296 bytes transferred. Overall this generates approximately 800 Kb per day, per site.

#### **Traffic Direction**

UC140/240 establishes an outgoing TCP connection from your network to the UltraSync platform. Once this outgoing TCP connection has been established, traffic over that connection is 2 way.

#### **Additional Protocols**

Only TCP is required from your network.

#### **Port Forwarding**

No ports need to be forwarded in the incoming direction. The outgoing TCP connection connects to port 443 or 10443 on the UltraSync network, so you would need to allow outgoing access to port 443 or 10443 if you block that by default.

#### **NAT**

NAT is not required.

#### **4G/2G Requirements**

You do not need to route mobile traffic. The mobile connection from the communicator through to the UltraSync platform and on to the CS is entirely independent of your network.

#### **DHCP and Static Addressing**

The communicators can be configured as either DHCP clients or with specific static IP addresses on your internal network as you prefer.

#### **DNS Server**

The device uses host names for establishing connection to the servers, so DNS addresses are required.

### **Checking Cellular Coverage**

The OpenSignal app is a commonly used tool for checking cellular coverage. It may assist installers in identifying a suitable location for UC140/UC240.

The device supplier does not warrant or support this app.

- 1. Download and install OpenSignal app on your smart phone.
- 2. Open the app.
- 3. Click to view the coverage map.
- 4. Set the app to the same carrier and 2G/4G network.
- 5. Enter the address of the site or browse the map.

If the signal level is poor in the area, this indicates you may need to install an external high gain antenna to provide a good signal.

**Tips**

- Signal level is affected by environmental conditions such as weather, and factors beyond the control of the equipment supplier.
- Signal level is dynamic and constantly changes. The signal level reported by UC140/UC240 is only for that specific moment. Wait a few minutes before checking

signal level again if you have repositioned the unit or the antenna.

- UltraSync Portal displays a historical signal level graph which may be useful to identify signal trend at a site. For example, a history of good signal level followed by a recent sharp drop may indicate a cellular network issue or physical interference in the area.
- The signal level displayed on the UltraSync Portal may not match the value displayed on UC140/UC240 due to the different measurement times.

### **Check Reporting Paths**

UltraSync is a cloud-based service that allows remote management and remote access to an UC140/UC240 system if enabled.

- 1. Wait 5 min after powering up to allow all paths to connect and register on to the respective networks.
- 2. Log in to the Web Server.
- 3. Click Settings.
- 4. Select Status in the drop-down menu.
- 5. Check Ethernet path is connected:
	- UltraSync Status: Online
	- IP Path: Online
	- IP Status: Connected
	- IP Media: Ethernet

If it does not:

- Check cable connections.
- Check router settings allow Internet access to LAN devices.

- 6. Check Cellular Path is connected:
	- UltraSync Status: Online
	- Mobile Path: Online
	- Signal Strength: −85 to −80 dBm for 2G,
	- or −110 to −100 dBm for 4G.

If it does not:

- Check Technology displays "Connected". This may take up to 5 min from power on.

- Check Signal level is at better than −85 dBm for 2G, or −110 dBm for 4G.

- Check supplied SIM card is correctly inserted into SIM1 slot.

- Check antennas are connected, move antennas to a higher location, or install a high gain antenna.

- Contact your service provider to check the SIM card is active and data is enabled.

- Contact your service provider to check UC140/UC240 has been provisioned and is enabled for reporting.

### **Web Error Messages**

Various error messages may appear in the UC140/UC240 Web Server.

### **EN 50136 Compliance**

Access to the configuration options by an installer must be authorised by a level 2 user. e.g. site owner. For the UltraSync alarm transmission equipment, compliance is achieved at

installation by requiring a one-time authorisation agreed as part of a service level agreement. It's recommended the signed authorisation is retained with the 'as fitted' documentation.

An example authorisation form is provided in "Appendix 1: Example Authorisation Form" on page 15.

To comply with EN 50136-2 Clause 5.2 Access levels, the default PIN must be changed and set to a minimum of 6-digits. You can change the access PINs in the USER settings. This applies for all types of access to the device.

### **Communications Path Monitoring**

The UC140 UltraSync Communicator unit is a wireless single path, roaming SIM, alarm signalling unit for transmitting alarm signals from a customer's alarm panel, via the Carrier UltraSync network to an Central Monitoring Centre (CMS) using pass-through mode of operation. The unit has a roaming SIM with 4G/2G mobile technology and must be activated via the UltraSync Webportal before it will communicate. Once connected to the platform the unit uses a poll and response check to determine path status. Path fail alarm is platform generated if the unit failed to respond in the required period.

The UC240 UltraSync Communicator unit is a dual path alarm signalling units for transmitting alarm signals from a customer's alarm panel, via the Carrier UltraSync network, to an Central Monitoring Centre (CMS) using pass-through mode of operation. The unit uses IP as its primary path with dual SIM 4G/2G mobile technology as the backup path. It is designed for use in both Security and Fire systems.

The unit must be activated on the Carrier UltraSync network using the UltraSync Webportal before it will communicatre. Once connected to the platform the unit uses a poll and response check to determine path status. When the primary path fails the secondary path will take up the polling and reporting parameters of the primary path.

Individual path fails are transmitted over the remaining path. Dual path failure is platform generated if the unit failed to respond in the required period.

### **Fire labelling for EN 54-21 (UC240 only)**

The following EN 54 label is included as part of the UC240 carton. In accordance with the requirements of clause 8 of EN 54-21 this label must be applied during installation to the outside of the enclosure.
