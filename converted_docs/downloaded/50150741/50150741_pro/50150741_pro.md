### **Product Overview**

Poynting's new PUCK range offers a small profile antenna for use in the IoT/M2M, Smart Meter, Smart Utilities, Transportation, Marine and the Agricultural/Farming markets. The PUCK (for 2G/3G/4G) covers the 690MHz to 3800MHz band, this includes the most popular international LTE bands. The PUCK exceeds the performance of many competitors due to the attention to design of this high-performance antenna. The radiation patterns of all radiating elements provide an excellent balance between omnidirectionality, pattern diversity and good radiation abilities at the desired elevation, which is often overlooked in such a small size antenna. Despite its small size, this antenna provides excellent performance especially at the higher frequency bands, where performance is critical for LTE throughput and connection stability.

### **Features**

- Fire Resistant (complies with ECE-R 118.02)
- UV Stable Enclosure
- Ground plane independent performs consistently with and without a ground plane
- 5G Ready; includes 3.2GHz to 3.8GHz CBRS Band
- Easy installation; multi implementation options (as standard)
	- Spigot Mount
	- Magnetic Mount
	- Adhesive Tape Mount
	- Bracket Mount

### **Application Areas**

### **Voltage Standing Wave Ratio (VSWR)***

VSWR is a measure of how efficiently radio-frequency power is transmitted from a power source, through a transmission line, into a load. In an ideal system, 100% of the energy is transmitted which corresponds to a VSWR of 1:1.

The PUCK-1 delivers superior performance across all bands with a VSWR of ≤2.5:1 over 85% of the band

*Measured with 2m low loss cable

### **Gain in dBi**

6 dBi is the peak gain across all bands from 690-960, 1710-2700 & 3400-3800 MHz

Peak Gain @ different bands: -1 dBi @690-960MHz Peak Gain @ different bands: 6.0 dBi @ 1710-2700MHz Peak Gain @ different bands: 6.0 dBi @3400-3800MHz
