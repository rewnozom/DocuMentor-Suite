# **Product description**

The Air Quality Sensor monitors indoor air quality through continuous detection of volatile organic compound (VOC) levels.

The sensor provides information on the VOC levels, so adverse health affects caused by unhealthy indoor air can be prevented.

By monitoring indoor air quality, the Air Quality Sensor helps you ensure that the air inside the room is clean and healthy.

# **Precautions**

- Do not remove the product label as it contains important information.
- Be aware that electronics are sensitive to static electricity, so aim to discharge before touching, and avoid touching any components inside the device.
- Avoid placing the sensor close to radiators or electromagnetic fields.
- Do not paint the sensor.
- To ensure appropriate calibration, the sensor must be exposed to clean air for at least 10 minutes on a weekly basis.

# **Placement**

a.

### **PLACE THE SENSOR**

- Indoors at a temperature between 0-50°C.
- Inside the room, in which you want to monitor VOC levels.
- On a wall, where it is reachable for battery replacement and maintenance.

# **Mounting**

- 4. Make sure that the sensor has joined a network before closing the casing.
### **Connecting**

- When the batteries are inserted, the Air Quality Sensor will start searching (up to 15 minutes) for a Zigbee network to join.
- Make sure that the Zigbee network is open for joining devices and will accept the sensor.
- While the sensor is searching for a Zigbee network to join, the LED flashes red.

- the sensor on the wall. When the LED stops flashing, the sensor has successfully joined the Zigbee network.
	- If the scanning has timed out, a short press on the round menu button will restart it.

Resetting is needed if you want to connect your Air Quality Sensor to another gateway or if you need to perform a factory reset to avoid abnormal behavior.

### **STEPS FOR RESETTING**

- 1. Open the casing of the sensor.
- 2. Press and hold the round menu button inside the device.

- 3. While you are holding the button down, the LED first flashes once, then two times in a row, and finally numerous times in a row.
- 4. Release the button while the LED is flashing numerous times in a row.
- 5. After you release the button, the LED shows one long flash, and the reset is completed.

## **Fault finding & cleaning**

- In case of a bad or wireless weak signal, change the location of the Air Quality Sensor. Otherwise you can relocate your gateway or strengthen the signal with a smart plug.
- If the search for a gateway has timed out, a short press on the button will restart it.

# **Battery replacement**

The device will blink twice every minute when the battery is low.

**CAUTION:** Risk of explosion if batteries are replaced by an incorrect type. Dispose of the batteries in accordance with instructions.

**CAUTION:** When removing cover for battery change - Electrostatic Discharge (ESD) can harm electronic components inside

- Open the casing of the Air Quality Sensor to replace the batteries.
- Replace the batteries respecting the polarities.
- Close the casing of the sensor.

### **Disposal**

Dispose the product and batteries properly at the end of their lives. This is electronic waste which should be recycled.
