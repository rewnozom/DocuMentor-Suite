#### The second life of an old wired alarm

MultiTransmitter opens new markets and allows building modern complex security based on existing wired equipment installed at a facility.

Ajax s security system users get security control via app, data-rich notifications, and scenarios with this integration module and old third-party wired devices.

An installer can set up the system or device in the PRO app, both while on-site and remotely.

Technical Data Sheet: MultiTransmitter 2

We'll stop shipping old versions of MultiTransmitter in favor of the new one. New devices will have different packaging with 3EOL icons to avoid confusion. Choose and install the equipment that precisely matches the client's needs.

## Maximum compatibility with the new firmware

MultiTransmitter allows connecting a wide range of wired sensors. The integration module with firmware version 2.13.0 and higher supports NC, NO, EOL, 2EOL, and 3EOL connection types. EOL resistance detects automatically in the PRO app.

The device supports EOL's with resistance from 1 kΩ to 15 kΩ1 each with total resistance of 30 kΩ. To increase the protection against sabotage, EOL's with different resistance can be used in one sensor. MultiTransmitter has three independent 12 V⎓ power outputs for third-party wired sensors: one for fire sensors and two for the rest devices. Recommended EOL ratio: R1=R , R2=2·R , R3=3·R .

MultiTransmitter has four 12 V⎓ power outputs for third-party wired sensors: one for fire sensors and three for other devices.

### Two-way encrypted communication

Jeweller is a two-way wireless data transfer protocol that provides fast and reliable communication between hub and devices. The protocol delivers instant data-rich alarms: security companies and users know which device was triggered, when and where it happened.

Jeweller features encryption and authentication to prevent forgery and polling to display devices status in real time. Supporting up to 2,000 m of wireless connectivity, Jeweller is ready to protect facilities and deliver the best user experience for both end users and installers.

Up to 2,000 m of two-way encrypted
