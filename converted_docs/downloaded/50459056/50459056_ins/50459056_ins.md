As it is the two-way communication, you will know whether the system has received the SpaceControl command.

Operating as part of the Ajax security system, the key fob is connected to the via the protected protocol. In addition, the key fob can be used to control any third party security central unit through the or integration module. hub Jeweller uartBridge ocBridge Plus

The key fob is set up through the iOS and Android-based . mobile app for smartphones

- **1.** System arming button
- **2.** System disarming button
- **3.** Night mode button
- **4.** Panic button (activates the alarm)
- **5.** Light indicators
- **6.** The hole for attaching the key fob

Buttons can be assigned when using a key fob with hub and Ajax uartBridge. At the moment, the feature of modification of commands (and deactivation) of the key fob buttons when using with the Ajax hub is not available.

# Using the key fob

Maximum connection distance between the key fob and the hub — 1,300 meters. This distance is reduced by walls, inserted floors and any objects hindering the signal transmission.

SpaceControl operates only with one security system (Ajaх or third-party system via the integration module). If you connect the key fob to a new security system, it will cease to interact with the previous system. However, the key fob will not be automatically deleted from the list of devices of the hub.

**The key fob can:**

- **Arm the system** press the button once
- **Turn on the night mode** press the button once
- **Disarm the system** press the button once
- **Switch on an alarm** press the button once

To turn off the actuated security system (siren), press the disarming mode button on the keyfob.

Accidental click protection is available on the SpaceControl with **firmware version 5.54.1.0 and higher**.

### Operational Indication

The key fob reports its status only after any button is pressed.

Type and color of indication of the key fob display depends on the firmware version of the device. You can find out the firmware version in the **Ajax application** → **Devices** → **key fob**. Information about the firmware version is displayed at the very bottom.

Connecting the key fob to the Ajax Security System

### **Connection to hub**

#### **Before starting connection:**

- **1.** Following the hub instruction recommendations, install the on your smartphone. Create an account, add the hub to the application, and create at least one room. Ajax application
- **2.** Go to the Ajax application.
- **3.** Switch on the hub and check the internet connection (via Ethernet cable and/or GSM network).
- **4.** Ensure that the hub is disarmed and does not start updates by checking its status in the mobile application.

#### How to connect key fob to hub:

- **1.** Select the **Add Device** option in the Ajax application.
- **2.** Name the device, scan/write manually the **QR Code** (located inside the body, on the battery fixture and packaging), and select the location room.
- **3.** Select **Add** the countdown will begin.
- **4.** Simultaneously press the button for armed mode and the panic button — the key fob will blink with the central LED. For the detection and interfacing to occur, the key fob should be located within the coverage area of the wireless network of the hub (at a single protected object).

Request for connection to the hub is transmitted for a short time at the time of switching on the device.

The key fob connected to the hub will appear in the list of devices of the hub in the application.

### Connecting the key fob to Third Party Security Systems

To connect the key fob to a third party security central unit using the or integration module, follow the recommendations in the manual of the respective device. Ajax uartBridge Ajax ocBridge Plus

# Key fob Maintenance and Battery Replacement

When cleaning the key fob body use any means suitable for equipment maintenance.

Do not use for cleaning SpaceControl any substances containing alcohol, acetone, gasoline and other active solvents.

The pre-installed battery provides up to 5 years of operation of the key fob during normal use (one arming and disarming of the security system per day). More frequent use can reduce battery life. You can check battery level at any time in the Ajax app.

![](_page_7_Picture_5.jpeg)

Keep new and used batteries away from children. Do not ingest battery, Chemical Burn Hazard.

The pre-installed battery is sensitive to low temperatures and if the key fob is significantly cooled, the battery level indicator in the app may show incorrect values until the key fob gets warm.

![](_page_8_Picture_1.jpeg)

The value of the battery level is not updated regularly, but only after pressing one of the buttons at the key fob.

When the battery is discharged, the user will receive a notification in the Ajax app, and the key fob LED will slowly light up and go out red each time the button is pressed (key fobs with **firmware version 3.16 and lower** light up green).
