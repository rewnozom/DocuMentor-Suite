# **NV37M**

**Installation Manual V1.0**

**Outdoor/Indoor Window and Sliding Door Dual Detector with Anti-Masking and Pet Immunity**

![](_page_0_Picture_3.jpeg)

## **General Description**

Thank you for choosing the NV37M for your professional protection needs. The NV37M wired version will provide you the most advanced window and sliding door protection either in Pet Immune or Sharp mode. If you have any comments, please write to us at Paradox.com/ products/feedback.

## **Recommended Installations (please read)**

Outdoor installation permits placements within frames of sliding windows or doors and presumes protection from raindrops. This ensures best catch performance, anti-masking ability, and pet alarm immunity.

Other installations are possible but in outdoor conditions, pet immunity can decrease. Moreover, space near the detector must be clear from obstacles from a distance of 30 to 40 cm (11.8 to 15.7 in.) within its pattern.

## **Installing the NV37M**

- 1. Remove the NV37M front cover open the Captive screw.

 **Figure 1 – Front Cover Figure 2 – Main Unit Figure 3 – Back Plate**

- 2. Remove the Main Unit open the two snap-lock mechanisms on each side of the back cover attaching the Main Unit to the back cover, then remove the Main Unit.
- 3. Pull the wires from the control panel through the knockout holes and mount the back cover onto the window frame or wall using screws.

#### *Note: PLEASE KEEP AT LEAST 4 cm / 1.5 in. clearance from window/shutter.*

An optional mounting bracket for the NV37M is available for ordering, part number: SB35.

- 4. Attach the Main Unit to the back cover ensure the locks snap closed.
- 5. Connect the wires to the terminal blocks according to the following wiring assignment.

**Table 1: Wiring Assignment**

7. Replace the front cover and close the Captive screw.

*Note: Do not obscure the detector's field of view.*

# **Testing the NV37M**

Perform a **Walk-Test** to test successful installation:

- 1. Walk slowly across the far end of the detection range.
- 2. Ensure detection.

Walk test mode lasts 5 minutes after the tamper screw is closed.
