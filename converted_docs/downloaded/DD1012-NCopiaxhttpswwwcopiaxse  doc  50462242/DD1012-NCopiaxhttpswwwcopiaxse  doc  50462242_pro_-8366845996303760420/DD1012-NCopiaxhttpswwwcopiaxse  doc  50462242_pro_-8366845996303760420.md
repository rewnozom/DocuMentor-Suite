# DD1012-N **12 m Dual Technology motion sensor, 9 curtains, digital pyro**

### **Patented range gated radar technology**

Motion sensors of the DD1000 Series incorporate a Carrier Fire & Security patented and unique range gated radar technology allowing the installer to define a clear borderline of the radar range as the radar is used to measure distance between the sensor and moving objects. Effectively the end-user will get rid of any nuisance alarms generated by movements outside the detection pattern.

Every motion sensor comes with 4 possible radar ranges selectable via dip switches allowing the detection pattern to be tailored according to the room where the motion sensor is installed. The radar operates on 5.8GHz frequency.

The DD1012-N motion sensor incorporates a new digital pyro for an improved signal quality and a better immunity to electrical interferences.

#### **PIR technology in combination with patented mirror optics**

Our patented optical mirror technology gives the advantage of gliding focus, which creates a continuous detection curtain from floor level up to installation height.

Within our DD1012 series we are using a dual element pyro generating 2 volumetric curtains for each of the 9 curtain sets.

#### **Detection technologies working together**

These dual tech motion sensors generate an alarm depending on what both technologies – range gated radar and PIR – saw within its detection coverage.

But our dual tech go beyond a simple "AND" function : it classifies the signals from each technology – range gated radar and PIR – to have the best alarm result without being sensitive for nuisance signal sources. This technology creates a uniform sensitivity in all course directions.

### **Ease and flexibility of installation**

- 1. Tolerates wall angle deviation and different mounting heights.
2. Limited loss of coverage when objects are placed in the field of the PIR vision.

- 3. Easy range setting via dip switches of the range gated radar in order to tailor the detection pattern to your needs.
- 4. Multiple build-in End-Of-Line resistor values with "easy wiring"

option available. 5. Plug-in connector.

## **Other members of the family**

This family includes motion sensors with variants in detection range, two types of anti-masking masking technology and Pet Immunity. The consistent family aesthetics between the various models ensure a professional approach when installing different sensor types.
