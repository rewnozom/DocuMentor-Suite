**PP500-Cotag** Access Control

## **Heavy duty card and PIN reader**

- **Cotag reader**
- **Cotag cards**
- **Card read distance up to 10 cm with active card or up to 5 cm with passive card**

The PP500-Cotag reads unique Cotag cards and tags (both active and passive) which offers ultimate convenience and cost-efficiency. It has a reading range of up to 12 cm with an active card and up to 3 cm with a passive card. It has a position indicator light and an illuminated keypad which makes it easy to use in dark places. It also includes a tamper switch for enhanced security.

When BC-Link is used, two of theses readers can be installed to control entries and exits using only one door controller. An additional benefit of BC-Link is that it supports online status monitoring.
