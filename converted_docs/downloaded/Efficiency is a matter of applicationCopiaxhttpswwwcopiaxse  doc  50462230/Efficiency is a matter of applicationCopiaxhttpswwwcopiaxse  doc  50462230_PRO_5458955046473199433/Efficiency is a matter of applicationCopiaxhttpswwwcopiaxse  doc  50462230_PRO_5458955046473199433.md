#### **EFFICIENCY IS A MATTER OF APPLICATION**

The innovative technology in the TS 5000 SoftClose separates the closing speed from the latching action speed. The latching action speed can be set with variable adjustment over the last 15° – the door can close in a controlled manner. Your advantage: the door closer is simple and quick to adjust!

#### **SAFETY IS A MATTER OF APPLICATION**

The TS 5000 SoftClose delivers all-round safety: Doors with access control are closed safely, with reliable compliance to all regulations, e.g. for fire protection and building protection. And since the TS 5000 SoftClose is also individually adjustable, it prevents loud slamming doors in noise-sensitive areas, even under difficult conditions such as varying air pressures acting on the door leaf.
