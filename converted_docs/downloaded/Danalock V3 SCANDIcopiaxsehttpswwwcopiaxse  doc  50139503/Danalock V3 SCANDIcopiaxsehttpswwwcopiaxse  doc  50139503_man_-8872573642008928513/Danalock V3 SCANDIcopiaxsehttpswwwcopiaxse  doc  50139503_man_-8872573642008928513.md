# **Tools needed:**

# **Parts involved:**

![](_page_4_Figure_1.jpeg)

#### **1. Secure the front lock**

Before removing your existing lock, use tape to secure the outside keyhole. This will keep it in place as you remove the screws on the inside.

### **2. Remove the inside thumb-turn**

First you have to remove the inside thumb-turn. Set aside the screws. You'll reinstall them in step 5.

### **3. Normal tailpiece length**

Most doors have tailpieces that extend 10 mm from the doorplate. They will fit the Danalock without need for any adjustments to their lenght!

If the tailpiece is less than 10 mm from the door surface, an extra tailpiece can be found in the Danalock box. (See illustration p. 10).

The Danalock V3 works with a tailpiece length up to 35 mm at maximum.

If the tailpiece length exceeds 35 mm you will have to shorten it. (See illustration p. 12).

#### **4. Tailpiece too short - insert a new**

If the tailpiece is less than 10 mm you have to remove the plate that holds the tailpiece and replace it with the tailpiece from the Danalock box.

You then need to shorten the new tailpiece after you have mounted the back plate. (Read more on p. 12).

#### **5. Remove the paper from the stickers**

Find the backplate in the Danalock box and remove the paper from the three stickers on the backside of the backplate.

### **6. Mounting the backplate on the door**

Place the backplate where the thumb-turn used to be. The round hole in the middle is for the tailpiece. Use the 2 screws from the thumb-turn to attach the backplate.

### **7. Give the tailpiece the right length**

To avoid damaging the Danalock you will have to shorten the new tailpiece to max. 35 mm from the door surface. Use two pliers or a wire cutter to shorten the tailpiece.

#### **8. Attach the tailpiece adaptor**

Choose the green tailpiece adaptor from the Danalock box and insert the tailpiece adaptor in the center tube on the backside of the Danalock. Press on the adaptor until a click ensures it is fixed firmly to the Danalock.

### **9. Fit and fasten the Danalock**

Fit the Danalock over the backplate with the battery cover facing down, the tailpiece sliding into the adapter and the backplate notches into the back of the lock.

## **10. Align the platemarks**

Find the small marking at the edge of the backplate and

align it with the hole in the cover ring surrounding the Danalock. Now you are sure to hit the notches on the backplate with the Danalock.

#### **11. Fasten the Danalock**

Turn the Danalock clockwise until it clicks to fasten it to the backplate. **NOTE:** If you need to unfasten and retry, see "Uninstall instructions" on p. 22.

#### **12. Activate batteries**

Pull out the plastic tab to activate the batteries. A light will flash to confirm the Danalock is ready.

**Note:** If the batteries are disconnected, you will have to re-calibrate the Danalock.

# **13. Before downloading the app**

Your Danalock is now attached to the door. Download and open the Danalock app to finish setting it up.

Leave the door open, so the lock isn't influenced when calibrated.

### **14. Download the Danalock app**

Go to Google Play or App Store and download the Danalock app. When the app is installed you create a user profile by pressing the blue ring. You will use this profile each time you sign into the app.

If you have a user profile use the green ring.

#### **15. Add the lock in the Danalock app**

When you have logged in you will see your empty keychain. Press "Add lock" at the bottom of the screen.

A guide will now lead you through the installation and configuration of your Danalock.

# **16. Dismount instructions**

If at any time you need to dismount the Danalock from your door, insert a pen tip into the hole at the top inner edge of the lock and press while turning the lock counter-clockwise until the lock releases.

This will not reset the lock or disconnect it from your account, but the lock may need to be re-calibrated if fastened to your door again.

### **17. LED-Signals**

A LED light on the Danalock indicates the status of several operations with different colours:

| LED-Mode                           | LED colour | Status indication                 |
|------------------------------------|------------|-----------------------------------|
| Constant red till light finishes   |            | Lock has successfully locked      |
| Constant green till light finishes |            | Lock has successfully unlocked    |
| Constant white for 3 seconds       |            | Power on. Batteries are activated |
| Red light flashes every 5 minute   |            | Critical battery level            |
| Constant purple                    |            | Firmware is being updated         |
| Blue light flashes                 |            | Settings are changed/saved        |

### **18. How to operate the Danalock V3 with click-commands**

You can control the Danalock via a switch reached through the small hole on top of the lock. You have 5 seconds before the Danalock engages the activity, giving you plenty of time to click the switch the right number of times. Notice: If you make a wrong number of clicks you can cancel by clicking 7 times.
