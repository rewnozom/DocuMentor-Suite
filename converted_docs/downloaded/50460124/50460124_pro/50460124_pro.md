# **Panic Button Alert button for emergencies**

The Panic Button is a wearable alert button that enables the user to call for help in emergencies. The wireless button can be placed anywhere or carried around by the user, with an option to use a necklace or a wristband. These options allow for use cases in home care or security solutions.

Vulnerable people such as the elderly or the disabled can wear the Panic Button around the wrist or the neck and use it to call for help. It can further be placed in rooms with a high risk of accidents as the bathroom and users can get help in case of emergencies.

The Panic Button can further be used as an alert button in security solutions. Placed under a desk or in reach from the cash register at businesses, a push of the button can trigger a silent alarm.

### **Independence and security of the elderly and disabled**

The risk of falling increases as people age, and it can be difficult for elderly people to get up on their own. A fall alarm for the elderly can, therefore, be a great help for themselves and their relatives, as it helps the elderly maintain an independent lifestyle in their own home.

Disabled people are vulnerable to dangers, even if they live on their own or together with family or a caregiver. The Panic Button can help the disabled person gain more independence and security.
