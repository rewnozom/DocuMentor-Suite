# **Functions**

# **Essential Video Analytics**

The built-in video analysis reinforces the Intelligenceat-the-Edge concept and now delivers even more powerful features. Essential Video Analytics is ideal for use in controlled environments with limited detection ranges.

The system reliably detects, tracks, and analyzes objects, and alerts you when predefined alarms are triggered. A smart set of alarm rules makes complex tasks easy and reduces false alarms to a minimum. Metadata is attached to your video to add sense and structure. This enables you to quickly retrieve the relevant images from hours of stored video. Metadata can also be used to deliver irrefutable forensic evidence or to optimize business processes based on people counting or crowd density information.

Calibration is quick and easy – just enter the height of the camera. The internal gyro/accelerometer sensor provides the rest of the information to precisely calibrate the video analytics.

# **Content Based Imaging Technology**

Content Based Imaging Technology (CBIT) is used to radically improve image quality in all lighting conditions and to identify areas for enhanced processing. The camera examines the scene using Essential Video Analytics and provides feedback to retune the image processing. This provides better detail in the areas that matter and better all-round performance. Intelligent Auto Exposure technology, for example, allows you to view moving objects in bright and dark areas of a scene.

### **Intelligent streaming reduces bandwidth and storage requirements**

The low-noise image and the efficient H.265 compression technology provide clear images while reducing bandwidth and storage by up to 80% compared to standard H.264 cameras. With this new generation of cameras an extra level of intelligence is added with Intelligent Streaming. The camera provides the most usable image possible by cleverly optimizing the detail-to-bandwidth ratio. The smart encoder continuously scans the complete scene as well as regions of the scene and dynamically adjust compression based on relevant information like movement. Together with Intelligent Dynamic Noise Reduction, which actively analyzes the contents of a scene and reduces noise artifacts accordingly, bitrates are reduced by up to 80%. Because noise is reduced at the source during image capture, the lower bitrate does not compromise image quality. This results in substantially lower storage costs and network strain and still retain a high image quality and smooth motion.

# **Area-based encoding**

Area-based encoding is another feature which reduces bandwidth. Compression parameters for up to eight user-definable regions can be set. This allows uninteresting regions to be highly compressed, leaving more bandwidth for important parts of the scene.

#### **Bitrate optimized profile**

The average typical optimized bitrate in kbits/s for various frame rates when in H.265 mode is shown in the table:

| fps | 1080p | 720p |
|-----|-------|------|
| 30  | 600   | 450  |
| 12  | 438   | 329  |
| 5   | 284   | 213  |
| 2   | 122   | 92   |

#### **Multiple streams**

The innovative multi-streaming feature delivers various H.264 or H.265 streams together with an M‑JPEG stream. These streams facilitate bandwidth-efficient viewing and recording as well as integration with thirdparty video management systems.

The camera can run multiple independent streams that allows to set a different resolution and frame rate on the first and second stream. The user can also choose to use a copy of the first stream.

The third stream uses the I-frames of the first stream for recording; the fourth stream shows a JPEG image at a maximum of 10 Mbit/s.

#### **Two-way audio and audio alarm**

Two-way audio allows the operator to communicate with visitors or intruders via an external audio line input and output. Audio detection can be used to generate an alarm if needed.

#### **Tamper and motion detection**

A wide range of configuration options is available for alarms signaling camera tampering. A built-in algorithm for detecting movement in the video can also be used for alarm signaling.

#### **Storage management**

Recording management can be controlled by the Bosch Video Recording Manager (Video Recording Manager) or the camera can use iSCSI targets directly without any recording software.

#### **Edge recording**

The MicroSD card slot supports up to 2 TB of storage capacity. A microSD card can be used for local alarm recording. Pre-alarm recording in RAM reduces recording bandwidth on the network, or — if microSD card recording is used — extends the effective life of the storage medium.

#### **Cloud-based services**

The camera supports time-based or alarm-based JPEG posting to four different accounts. These accounts can address FTP servers or cloud-based storage facilities (for example, Dropbox). Video clips or JPEG images can also be exported to these accounts. Alarms can be set up to trigger an e-mail or SMS notification so you are always aware of abnormal events.

#### **Easy installation**

Power for the camera can be supplied via a Powerover-Ethernet compliant network cable connection. With this configuration, only a single cable connection is required to view, power, and control the camera. Using PoE makes installation easier and more costeffective, as cameras do not require a local power source.

The camera can also be supplied with power from +12 VDC/24 VAC power supplies. To increase system reliability, the camera can be simultaneously connected to both PoE and +12 VDC/24 VAC supplies. Additionally, uninterruptible power supplies (UPS) can be used, which will allow continuous operation, even during a power failure.

For trouble-free network cabling, the camera supports Auto-MDIX which allows the use of straight or crossover cables.

# **Automatic image rotation**

The integrated gyro/accelerometer sensor automatically corrects the image orientation in steps of 90° if the camera is mounted at right angles or upside down. The sensor image can also be rotated manually through steps of 90°.

To efficiently capture details in long hallways without loss of resolution, mount the camera at right angles. The image is displayed upright at full resolution on your monitor.

# **True day/night switching**

The camera incorporates mechanical filter technology for vivid daytime color and exceptional night-time imaging while maintaining sharp focus under all lighting conditions.

#### **Hybrid mode**

An analog video output enables the camera to operate in hybrid mode. This mode provides simultaneous high resolution HD video streaming and an analog video output via an SMB connector. The hybrid functionality offers an easy migration path from legacy CCTV to a modern IP-based system.

#### **DORI coverage**

DORI (Detect, Observe, Recognize, Identify) is a standard system (EN-62676-4) for defining the ability of a camera to distinguish persons or objects within a covered area. The maximum distance at which a camera/lens combination can meet these criteria is shown below:
