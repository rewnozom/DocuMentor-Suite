## **Warnings**

- Proper configuration of all passwords and other security settings is the responsibility of the installer and/or end-user.
- In the use of the product, you must be in strict compliance with the electrical safety regulations of the nation and region. Please refer to technical specifications for detailed information.

- Input voltage should meet both the SELV (Safety Extra Low Voltage) and the Limited Power Source with 24 VAC or 12 VDC according to the IEC60950-1 standard. Please refer to technical specifications for detailed information.
- Do not connect several devices to one power adapter as adapter overload may cause over-heating or a fire hazard.
- Please make sure that the plug is firmly connected to the power socket. When the product is mounted on wall or ceiling, the device shall be firmly fixed.
- If smoke, odor or noise rise from the device, turn off the power at once and unplug the power cable, and then please contact the service center.

![](_page_6_Picture_5.jpeg)

- Make sure the power supply voltage is correct before using the camera.
- Do not drop the camera or subject it to physical shock.
- Do not touch sensor modules with fingers. If cleaning is necessary, use clean cloth with a bit of ethanol and wipe it gently. If the camera will not be used for an extended period, please replace the lens cap to protect the sensor from dirt.
- Do not aim the camera at the sun or extra bright places. Blooming or smearing may occur otherwise (which is not a malfunction), and affect the endurance of sensor at the same time.

- The sensor may be burned out by a laser beam, so when any laser equipment is in using, make sure that the surface of sensor will not be exposed to the laser beam.
- Do not place the camera in extremely hot, cold (the operating temperature shall be-30°C ~+60°C, or -40°C ~ +60°C if the camera model has an "H" in its suffix), dusty or damp locations, and do not expose it to high electromagnetic radiation.
- To avoid heat accumulation, good ventilation is required for operating environment.
- Keep the camera away from liquid while in use.
- While in delivery, the camera shall be packed in its original packing, or packing of the same texture.
- Regular part replacement: a few parts (e.g. electrolytic capacitor) of the equipment shall be replaced regularly according to their average enduring time. The average time varies because of differences between operating environment and using history, so regular checking is recommended for all the users. Please contact with your dealer for more details.
- Improper use or replacement of the battery may result in hazard of explosion. Replace with the same or equivalent type only. Dispose of used batteries according to the instructions provided by the battery manufacturer.
- If the product does not work properly, please contact your dealer or the nearest service center. Never attempt to disassemble the camera yourself. (We shall not assume any responsibility for problems caused by unauthorized repair or maintenance.)
