# 2 GENERAL INFORMATION

# **2.1 Intended Use**

The GL7p may only be used for the convenient electronic locking of lockers in facilities such as leisure facilities, universities, companies, depots, and other individual company applications. Depending on the device type, identification at the GL7p is completed using contactless RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) data carriers or via PIN code. Data carriers that use MIFARE® and ISO 15693 RFID technology are supported by the GL7p.

*The GL7p is not available in the United States and Canada.*

# **2.3 Functional Description**

The GL7p is installed on the inner side of the locker door and is suitable for most types of locker material, e.g., sheet metal, wood, HPL, and solid plastic. The GL7p can be used with left- and right-hinged locker doors alike. The lock can be mounted both vertically and horizontally, which also makes it suitable for use in lockers with very low door heights. Due to its mechanical compatibility with standard locker locks and identical locks from other manufacturers, existing locker installations can be effortlessly upgraded using the GL7p. The existing holes of the previous standard locks can be directly re-used.

The GL7p is powered by one 3.6 V AA lithium battery (see ["8](#page--1-0) [TECHNICAL](#page--1-0) DATA"), which provides an operating life of up to 10 years* (at 10 activations per day and +20 °C room temperature) before requiring replacement. For configuration, the lock connects to a computer via USB and can then be configured using GAT Config Manager configuration software. The lock can operate in one of five operating modes thereby providing flexibility for different locking requirements within a facility.

### Using a locker

To use a locker, the user closes the door of their locker and while holding the door shut, presses the button of the GL7p in using their data carrier. The GL7p reads the data carrier information and determines whether the user is authorized to use the locker. When the user is authorized, the GL7p locks the locker door. The LED signals the locking action, and the button remains in the pressed-in position.

To unlock a previously locked locker, the user presses their data carrier onto the lock button. The GL7p reads the data carrier and checks that the authorization is valid before automatically unlocking the locker door.

** Different operating modes or configurations can reduce the battery lifespan.*

# **2.4 GL7p Variants**

# **2.5 Terminology**

Several key terms that are used often in this manual are defined below.

### **Computer / PC**

These terms refer to all desktop and laptop computers running a Microsoft® Windows® operating system.

### **Data Carrier**

A data carrier is a form of identification media that is used by staff and visitors in a facility for identification. Data carriers are available in a variety of different forms such as plastic wristbands and chip cards. Data carriers are also available to suit different RFID technologies (LEGIC, MIFARE® , ISO 15693).

### **System Data Carrier**

Several different types of System Data Carriers are used for programming, service and maintenance tasks. These data carriers have special functions and as they are essential for operation of the GL7p and have security-related features, they must be kept in a secure place and be protected against unauthorized use. Most of the System Data Carriers are included in the GAT ECO.Basic Set FD; however, some must be ordered separately as required.

### **FID (Company ID) and Site Key**

LEGIC systems use the FID number and in MIFARE® systems the site key is used, which is a combination of the FID and the read and write keys. The FID and site key are unique for every facility. These numbers are encoded in every data carrier and device used in the facility thereby ensuring that data carriers from one installation cannot be used in other installations.

### **GAT Config Manager**

GANTNER developed PC software that is used to configure GANTNER devices such as the GL7p. A separate manual is available and integrated into the software. While the software is open, click on the "Help" drop-down menu and select "How Do I".

### **Lock**

General term for the GL7p.

### **Locker**

The term "locker" is used to describe all possible locker applications that can be fitted with a GANTNER electronic lock. Typical applications include a changing room locker, a deposit box, or a private box.

### **RFID (Radio-Frequency Identification)**

Identification over a short distance using radio frequency. An RFID data carrier is used to identify users in GANTNER systems.

### **Wireless**

Identification via a wireless interface in the range 2.402 to 2.48 GHz, over which identification and locker operation from several meters, e.g., via an app on a smartphone, is possible.

### **User / Guest / Visitor**

These general terms refer to the people in a facility who use the locker system with GANTNER locker locks, data carriers, and other GANTNER devices on a daily basis.

### **Left locker door / right locker door**

Door opening direction according to DIN 107, i.e., whether the hinges or axis of rotation of the door are on the left or right when looking at the locker door. For more information see ["3.7. Definition of the Door Direction](#page--1-20) (Right or Left [Door)"](#page--1-20).

NOTE! These installation instructions describe how to install the GL7p locker lock. Please read this section carefully prior to working on the lockers or installing the locks.

### *Risk of damage or failure to the GL7p*

- *Read the information in this section carefully before installing the GL7p.*
- *Carefully observe the installation diagrams.*
- *Use the correct tools to install the GL7p.*

# **3.1 Target Group**

This chapter provides information for technicians who install the GL7p. Experience in mechanical work and basic electrical knowledge is required. Previous knowledge of the GL7p is not required.

# **3.2 Test Installation**

As the GL7p is suitable for a wide range of installation applications, always perform a test installation including functional testing of the GL7p in a sample locker from the facility before starting with the mass production of lockers.

Ensure that the latch of the lock slides easily in and out without resistance of the opening in the locker body. Also test that the GL7p locks and unlocks as required, ideally using a data carrier of the same type to be used with the locker system to ensure that the data carrier functions as required.

# **3.3 Replacement after a Burglary Attempt**

If a burglary (forced opening) is attempted or occurs at a locker, the entire GL7p including the locker door must be replaced with a new one.

# **3.4 Operating Conditions**

The GL7p is suitable for locker doors made of metallic and non-metallic materials. The lock may only be used indoors (see section ["8.8](#page--1-63) [Environmental Conditions"](#page--1-63)).

The installation in lockers with metallic doors does not differ from the installation of lockers with non-metallic doors.

# **3.5 Door Width and Thickness**

The GL7p is suitable for locker doors with a door leaf thickness of 1 to max. 28 mm. Depending on the thickness of the door leaf, different screws and/or the supplied spacer sleeve must be used for anti-rotation prevention. For details, see ["3.8.3](#page--1-14) [Instructions for Installing the GL7p"](#page--1-14).

When installing the GL7p in lockers with narrow doors, ensure that the GL7p does not touch the locker body when opening and closing the door (see following picture).

![](_page_21_Figure_5.jpeg)

*Figure 3.1 – Width and thickness of the locker door*

# **3.6 Latch Types**

There are straight and offset latches and both types are available with a closed or hooked end. The hooked latches provide additional protection against break-in as the hook is engaged with the bolt (see ["3.8.2](#page--1-0) [Measurements for](#page--1-0)  [Hooked Latches"](#page--1-0) for more information).

![](_page_21_Figure_9.jpeg)

The GL7p comes with a standard latch. This is a straight latch and when installing in a new locker, the position of the latch stop in the locker body must be aligned accordingly so that the latch is present at the stop when the door is closed. The distance from the underside (mounting side) of the GL7p to the latch is 34 mm (1.34 in) (see following picture).

![](_page_21_Figure_11.jpeg)

*Figure 3.2 – Standard latch included*

To retrofit the GL7p into existing lockers, GANTNER also offers offset latches that can be adapted to an existing latch stop. In this case, please contact GANTNER Electronic GmbH or your local sales partner to order a suitable latch.

NOTE! To ensure the safe operation of the GL7p, do not bend or modify the supplied latch yourself.

To find the exact measurement for the latch, follow these steps.

- ► Install the supplied standard latch.
- ► Lock the GL7p using a valid data carrier or PIN code while keeping the locker door closed so far that the latch retracts exactly into the existing latch opening in the locker wall.

![](_page_22_Figure_7.jpeg)

*Figure 3.3 – Measuring the required latch offset using the supplied latch*

- ► Measure the gap size of the door from the edge of the locker body to the point of impact on the door (i.e., to the inside of the door or any bump stops).
- ► The latch must be offset by the measured gap size.

![](_page_22_Figure_11.jpeg)

*Figure 3.4 – Example of offset latch for existing locker*

![](_page_23_Picture_0.jpeg)

- 
- ► Please provide the latch length (A) and latch offset (B) to your distributor or GANTNER Electronic when ordering the offset latch.

*Figure 3.5 – Measuring the required length and offset of the latch*

- *The "GL7p Cam Ordering Guide" provides an overview of the possible latch types and measurements. Some latches with part numbers are listed here. Please use one of these latches if possible or else provide the correct measurements when ordering.*
![](_page_23_Figure_6.jpeg)

# **3.7 Definition of the Door Direction (Right or Left Door)**

For installation, it is important to determine whether the locker door is a "right" or "left" door. These terms are used in this manual as defined in DIN 107. Accordingly, when looking at the opening surface, i.e., the side of the door side that swings open, the hinge or the axis of rotation is on the left for a left door and on the right for a right door. See the following pictures:

![](_page_24_Figure_2.jpeg)

*Figure 3.6 – Locker door hinge definition (left/right) for vertical mounting of the lock*

![](_page_24_Figure_4.jpeg)

*Figure 3.7 – Locker door hinge definition (left/right) for horizontal mounting of the lock*

The position of the GL7p latch is different for right and left-hinged doors and you can change the position yourself (see ["3.8.3](#page--1-14) [Instructions for Installing the GL7p"](#page--1-14)).

The installation for right-hinged doors is described in the following pages. The installation process for left-hinged doors is the same as for right-hinged doors, except that the locker door is rotated 180° and when the GL7p is mounted horizontally, the lock is also rotated 180°.

# **3.8 Installation of the GL7p**

After determining the alignment of the lock and the door stop, the mounting holes can be drilled. The following description shows the holes for a right-hinged door with vertical lock mounting.

NOTE! Before installing all locks in a new locker system, a test installation of one lock into a completed locker and a functional check must be performed. See section "3.2. [Test Installation"](#page--1-16).

### *3.8.1 Mounting Holes in the Door*

Two holes must be drilled in the door. If a DD cut-out with 19.1 x 16.1 mm (0.75 x 0.63 in) already exists, e.g., when replacing an existing mechanical lock, this can also be used.

### **Vertical mounting Horizontal mounting**

![](_page_25_Figure_8.jpeg)

![](_page_25_Figure_9.jpeg)

- 1. Hole or DD cut-out for mounting thread (measurements in mm, inches shown in brackets)
- 2. Hole for anti-rotation prevention
- 3. Lock position after installation
- 4. Locker door

*Figure 3.8 – Mounting holes in the door (measurements for standard latch shown)*

- ► For the mounting thread, drill a hole (1) of Ø 19.1 mm (0.75 in) in the locker door. If a DD cut-out with 19.1 x 16.1 mm (0.75 x 0.63 in) already exists, e.g., when replacing an existing mechanical lock, this can also be used.
- ► A second hole (2) of Ø 7.5 mm (0.29 in) is also required in the locker door to prevent rotation of the lock.

### *3.8.2 Measurements for Hooked Latches*

If a hooked latch is being used, the hooked end engages into a bolt for additional protection against break-in. The bolt must be correctly installed according to the bolt size.

![](_page_26_Picture_4.jpeg)

*Figure 3.9 – Dimensions for latches with hook ends (measurements in mm)*

Measurement A depends on the type of bolt being used (standard bolt = 36 mm). The bolt must be positioned according to this measurement minus the cut-out measurements of the bolt shown in the picture. The cut-out measurements of the hook end specified here are the same for all latches in the GANTNER range.

### *3.8.3 Instructions for Installing the GL7p*

After drilling the mounting holes, complete the following steps to install the GL7p according to the installation diagram.

# 4 COMMISSIONING

# **4.1 Target Group**

This chapter provides information for technicians responsible for putting the GL7p into operation. A base knowledge of electronics is assumed. Previous knowledge of the GL7p is not required.

# **4.2 Power Supply**

### *4.2.1 Battery Information*

The GL7p is powered by one 3.6 V AA lithium battery (see "8. [TECHNICAL](#page--1-0) DATA"). The life of the battery depends on the number of locking cycles (frequency of use of the lock) and the ambient conditions . The battery must be replaced with a new one when the battery voltage becomes too low. If the battery becomes too weak, the locker can no longer be locked. The GL7p indicates a low battery condition by blinking the LED 5 times red during an unlocking and a locking attempt, and the lock emitting 5 beeps.

NOTE! Only the GANTNER approved batteries may be used to power the GL7p (see "8. [TECHNICAL](#page--1-0) DATA").

### *4.2.2 Inserting the Battery*

To put the GL7p into operation, insert the battery into the battery compartment of the GL7p. To access the battery compartment, the battery cover must be opened using the battery key included in the "GAT ECO.Basic Set FD".

![](_page_30_Figure_11.jpeg)

*Figure 4.1 – Opening the battery compartment of the GL7p*

- ► Insert the battery compartment key (3) into the slot (1) on the side of the GL7p.
	- o The battery compartment cover unlocks.
- ► Remove the battery compartment cover (2).
- ► Insert the battery (4) into the battery compartment with the polarity as shown in the following picture.

![](_page_31_Figure_2.jpeg)

*Figure 4.2 – Insert battery - observe the correct polarity*

- ► Replace the battery compartment cover onto the battery compartment and push it down until it clicks into place.
- ► Press the button of the GL7p in completely using the BATTERY data carrier.
	- o The BATTERY data carrier is read by the GL7p and, if read correctly, the GL7p is enabled.

### *4.2.3 Replacing the Battery*

The battery of the GL7p must be replaced when the LED flashes red 5 times and 5 acoustic signals are emitted during a locking or unlocking attempt. In this state, the GL7p can no longer be locked until the batteries are replaced.

![](_page_31_Picture_9.jpeg)

*Always dispose of used batteries in an environmentally friendly manner, e.g., at an electronic waste recycling facility.*

To ensure that the time and date remain correct after a battery change, the battery replacement must not take longer than 3 minutes. If the GL7p is without battery for more than 3 minutes, the time and date must be reset. Since the time may be different from the real time after prolonged use of the GL7p, GANTNER recommends resetting the time and date after each battery change (see section "5. [CONFIGURATION"](#page--1-0)).

Following battery replacement, the GL7p must be returned to its normal operating mode using the "BATTERY" data carrier (= battery cover key) (see section "6.5.5. BATTERY [Data Carrier"](#page--1-0)).

- ► Complete the instructions described in section "4.2.2. [Inserting the Battery"](#page--1-24).
- ► Press the locker door shut with one hand and hold it shut.
- ► Press the button of the GL7p in completely using the BATTERY data carrier.
	- o The BATTERY data carrier is read by the GL7p and, if read correctly, the GL7p is enabled.

![](_page_32_Picture_6.jpeg)

*Figure 4.3 – Activating the GL7p with the BATTERY data carrier*

*After battery replacement, it is recommended to always check the date and time of the GL7p and set them correctly if necessary.*

# **4.3 USB Connection**

To connect to a computer with Windows® operating system (Windows® 7 or higher), a Micro-B USB port is provided on the side of the GL7p. The USB port location on the side of the lock allows configuration to be carried out even while the lock is installed. Use the correct USB cable (e.g., the USB cable included in the GAT ECO.Basic Set FD (Part No. 1100550).

NOTE! The maximum cable length between the GL7p and a computer is 5 m. The Micro-B USB connector can have a maximum width of 4 mm.

![](_page_33_Picture_1.jpeg)

After the USB cable is connected, the SERVICE data carrier (see "6.5.6 SERVICE [Data Carrier"](#page--1-51)) is used to put the GL7p into configuration mode. A 3 m USB cable, the SERVICE data carrier, and GAT Config Manager configuration software are included in the GAT ECO.Basic Set (see section ["6.4](#page--1-0) [GAT ECO.Basic Set FD"](#page--1-0)).

To configure the GL7p via PC/laptop:

- ► Start GAT Config Manager on the PC/laptop.
- ► Connect the USB cable (type-A end) to a spare USB port on the PC/laptop.

![](_page_33_Picture_6.jpeg)

- ► Open the battery compartment (see section "4.2.2. [Inserting the Battery"](#page--1-24))
- ► Connect the Micro-B connector of the USB cable into the USB port on the GL7p.

![](_page_33_Figure_9.jpeg)

- o When the GL7p is connected to the computer for the first time, the driver is automatically installed, and the lock recognized.
*If the automatic driver installation does not work and you need the driver, it is availble on the "Leisure Software" USB stick in the GAT ECO.Basic Set or via the partner area of the GANTNER website.*

![](_page_34_Picture_0.jpeg)

- ► After connecting to the computer, the LED flashes red/green alternately (if the GL7p has already been configured once).
- ► Now press the button of the GL7p to activate configuration mode.

a) If the lock has not been configured yet (default setting), the GL7p only has to be connected.

b) If the lock has already been configured at least once, i.e., the default setting has been deactivated, the button must be pressed with the SERVICE data carrier from the Basic Set.

![](_page_34_Figure_6.jpeg)

- o The GL7p enters into configuration mode and the LED slowly pulses green to indicate this state.
- ► In GAT Config Manager, click on "Configure" to open the configuration settings.

Further information regarding configuring the GL7p is available in ["5. CONFIGURATION"](#page--1-0).

# 5 CONFIGURATION

### *RF exposure statement*

*The users must keep at least 20 cm separation distance from the device, except during the identification and operation process at the device (e.g., PIN-code input), which must be performed as described in this manual.*

# **5.1 General Information**

The GL7p can be configured using the PC software "ECO Lock Configurator". Configuration is also possible using the "GAT Config Manager" software. However, it is recommended to use ECO Lock Configurator if you are not using GAT Config Manager already. To be able to use the same configuration for several locks, the configuration only needs to be created and saved once in GAT Config Manager or ECO Lock Configurator. It can then be imported into any lock that requires the same configuration. Different configurations can of course also be created.

An additional option is to complete the configuration using the MoLA app, which can be downloaded from the Google Play Store and used with mobile devices with an Android operating system. The app uses NFC for configuration, which means that the mobile device must also support NFC communication. See more details in section ["5.4.](#page--1-14) [Configuration with the MoLA App"](#page--1-14).

NOTE! After importing the configuration file to the first lock, complete an operational test to ensure the user and MASTER data carriers and the general lock functionality perform as expected.

The following data is imported into the GL7p during configuration:

- Site key
- Sub-site number
- Locker number
- Lock operating mode ("free locker", "free locker universal", "free locker unique number", "personal locker programming card", or "personal locker expiry date". See section ["6.3. Operating Modes"](#page--1-42))
- Free locker: Sector number of the data on the data carrier and the time setting for the "duration of use" function
- Date and time
- Unique numbers of the MASTER data carriers (and OPEN MASTER data carriers, if used)

*The MASTER data carriers and OPEN MASTER data carriers can also be directly programmed into the GL7p (see section "6.5.1 MASTER* [Data Carrier](#page--1-47)*"). However, the most efficient way to program the data carrier numbers into multiple locks is via PC and GAT Config Manager.*

NOTE! The GL7p does not set the daylight-saving time automatically. Time changes due to daylight saving must be considered when evaluating bookings and also when authorizing data carriers with expiry dates/times!

# **5.2 Configuration with GAT Config Manager**

### *5.2.1 Setup for Configuration in GAT Config Manager*

Once the GL7p is connected to the computer with the suitable USB cable (see "4.3. USB [Connection"](#page--1-26)), and the SERVICE data carrier used to activate configuration mode (see "6.5.6 SERVICE [Data Carrier"](#page--1-51)), the settings can be viewed and configured using GAT Config Manager.

It is also possible to read the booking data from the GL7p and update the lock with new firmware.

NOTE! Min. version 3.13 of GAT Config Manager software is required to configure the GL7p.

NOTE! The GL7p is powered by the USB cable, which means that the battery does not have to be inserted in the lock during configuration. Ensure however that the GL7p is not de-energized for more than 1 minute (e.g., after disconnecting the USB cable until the battery is inserted), otherwise the time and date will be erased. Complete the following steps to configure the GL7p via GAT Config Manager.

*There is a separate manual with detailed information on each function available in GAT Config Manager. To access the manual while the software is open, click on the "Help" menu and select "How Do I".*

- ► After installing the software, open GAT Configuration Manager via "Start" -> "All Programs" -> "GANTNER Electronic GmbH" -> "GAT Config Manager" -> "GAT Config Manager".
	- o The default start window of GAT Config Manager is displayed.
- ► Click on the "Open Project" icon ("1" in [Figure 5.1)](#page--1-64) to find an existing project.
- ► Alternatively, click on the "Create Project" icon ("2" in [Figure 5.1)](#page--1-64) to start a new project.

# **5.3 Configuration with ECO Lock Configurator**

### *5.3.1 Setup for Configuration in ECO Lock Configurator*

The ECO Lock Configurator software can read the configuration of a GL7p. The settings can be changed and uploaded to the lock. To do this, the GL7p must be connected to the computer with the appropriate USB cable (see section ["4.3](#page--1-26) USB [Connection"](#page--1-26)) and the configuration mode must be activated using the SERVICE data carrier (see ["6.5.6](#page--1-51) [SERVICE Data Carrier"](#page--1-51)).

It is also possible to read out the booking data and update the firmware of the GL7p.

NOTE: The GL7p is powered by the USB cable so the battery does not need to be in the lock during configuration. However, ensure that the GL7p is not de-energized for more than 1 minute (e.g., after disconnecting the USB cable until inserting the battery), otherwise the time and date will be deleted.

*There are separate instructions with detailed information on the individual functions of ECO Lock Configurator. The ECO Lock Configurator software is currently only available in English.*

ECO Lock Configurator automatically recognizes a connected GL7p.

- ► Start the software. Ensure that the "Single Lock" menu is selected in the sidebar to the left.
	- o The message "Waiting for lock ..." is displayed.

# **5.4 Configuration with the MoLA App**

The MoLA app, which is available for download via Google Play Store, can be used with a mobile device, e.g., a smartphone, to configure the GL7p locks. To use the MoLA app, the following requirements must be fulfilled:

- Mobile device with Android 4.4.0 or later
- Mobile device must be NFC enabled
- Mobile device must not be rooted
- The GL7p must have firmware version 2.4.0 or higher)
- A valid APP KEY data carrier is required for configuring on-site locks

The MoLA app can be downloaded with this link from Google Play Store:

![](_page_47_Picture_10.jpeg)

<https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gantner.mola>

*Due to technical limitations in iOS, the MoLA app is currently not available on Apple devices.*

You can change the same configuration settings in MoLA as in GAT Config Manager or ECO Lock Configurator (see ["5.5. Configuration Settings of the GL7p"](#page--1-0)). A detailed description about the operation of the app is included directly in MoLA.

The APP KEY data carrier is a special system data carrier (see ["6.5. Summary of System Data Carriers"](#page--1-46)) and is included in the GAT ECO.Basic Set. This data carrier is required to change the configuration of a GL7p or to make a new configuration of a lock that has already been configured once.

![](_page_47_Picture_15.jpeg)

*When the GL7p is in factory mode (default, unconfigured state), the APP KEY is not needed.*

Once the APP KEY data carrier is loaded into MoLA, it remains valid for a certain time period. When the session expires, the APP KEY is automatically deleted from the device. This prevents the APP KEY data carrier from being accessed by unwanted third-party apps, malware, etc.

# **5.5 Configuration Settings of the GL7p**

The important configuration settings of the GL7p that can be adjusted in GAT Config Manager or ECO Lock Configurator are explained in this section. A list and brief explanation of every configuration setting available for the GL7p is provided in section ["5.5.10](#page--1-14) [Configuration Settings Table"](#page--1-14).

### *5.5.1 Operating Mode*

The GL7p can operate in one of five different operating modes. See "6.3 [Operating Modes"](#page--1-42) for a detailed description of each mode. The operating mode setting is found here:

*Configuration > Operating mode > General > Operating mode*

- ► In the "Operating mode" menu, select either:
	- "FreeLocker"
	- "FreeLockerUniversal"
	- "FreeLockerUniqueNumber"
	- "PersonalLocker_ProgrammingCard", or
	- "PersonalLocker_ExpiryDate"

### *5.5.2 Locker Number*

The number of the locker where the GL7p is installed can be defined. The locker number setting is found here:

*Configuration > Operating mode > General > LockerNumber*

- ► Enter the locker number for the GL7p into the "Locker number" field.
### *5.5.3 Auto-Unlock*

The auto-unlock function automatically unlocks the GL7p at a defined point in time or after a specific time has elapsed after locking.

NOTE! When this function is activated, the lock will always unlock at the defined point of time regardless of the operating mode (see "6.3 [Operating Modes"](#page--1-42)).

The automatic unlocking function at a certain time after midnight is set via the following menu path:

*Configuration > Operating mode > General > AutoUnlock [min]*

- ► Enter a value representing the number of minutes into the field. The countdown time for unlocking begins at 00:00 (24 h). For example, a value of "300" means that the lock will unlock at 05:00 am. A value of "0" means that the function is inactive.
To use the automatic unlocking function after a certain time has elapsed after locking, first enable the option in the following configuration path:

*Configuration> Operating mode> General> AutoUnlock after locking active*

Next, you have to enter the desired time after a locking here:

*Configuration > Operating mode > General > AutoUnlock after locking [min]*

- ► Enter the time in minutes. The unlocking countdown therefore begins after each lock has been performed. For example, a value of "300" means that the lock will be automatically unlocked 5 hours after each time it is locked. If this function is activated, a value must be entered.
NOTE! For the automatic unlocking function, ensure that the correct time is set in the GL7p so that the automatic unlocking occurs at the correct time. Please note that the GL7p does not consider changes between summer and winter times.

### *5.5.4 Duration of Use*

Lockers operating in free locker mode can be configured to limit the user to a defined period of use. See section "6.3.1. Free Locker Mode [(with or without Duration of Use Function)"](#page--1-43) for detailed information. The duration of use function is found here:

*Configuration > Operating mode > FreeLocker*

- ► Select either "Duration" or "Point_of_time" from the "UseTimeLimit" menu for the type of time limit.
- ► Define the time limit in minutes in the "TimeLimit (min)" field.

### *5.5.5 Locking of Personal Locker without Data Carrier*

The functionality of locking personal lockers without data carriers allows the locker to lock automatically when the locker door is pushed shut, without needing to use a data carrier. The locker can be unlocked again using the data carrier(s) authorized to use the personal locker. The function is found here:

*Configuration > Operating mode > PersonalLocker > PreLock PersonalLocker*

- ► Select / deselect the "PreLock Personal Locker" option to turn the function on / off.
### *5.5.6 RF Standards*

The GL7p can operate with data carriers that use ISO 15693, ISO 14443A (MIFARE), and HID iCLASS (13.56 MHz UID) technology.

*The default setting of the GL7p is to operate with ISO 14443A (MIFARE) data carriers*.

The setting for the GL7p to operate with ISO 14443A (MIFARE) data carriers cannot be disabled. The setting for the GL7p to operate with ISO 15693 or HID iCLASS data carriers can be adjusted and is found here:

```
Configuration > Reader > RF Standards > ISO15693
or
Configuration > Reader > RF Standards > HID
```
- ► Select / deselect the "ISO 15693" or "HID" option to turn the setting on / off.
### *5.5.7 MASTER Data Carriers*

Up to 10 MASTER data carriers (also called MASTER cards) can be assigned to the GL7p to allow the locker to be opened in special circumstances, e.g., when a user has lost their data carrier. For this functionality, the MASTER data carriers must be first entered, which is done here:

*Configuration > Application > Master cards > MasterCard 1 - 10*

► Enter the number of each MASTER data carrier into the respective fields.

NOTE! The MASTER data carrier numbers must be entered in hexadecimal format.

*There is also an OPEN MASTER data carrier available (not included in the Basic Set). This special data carrier can be used like the MASTER data carriers to open all lockers; however, it cannot lock the lockers. It is possible to program an OPEN MASTER data carrier by entering the number of the OPEN MASTER data carrier into 1 of the 10 fields. In this case, only 9 MASTER data carriers can be used.*

### *5.5.8 Wireless Interface*

For GL7p variants with a wireless interface (variants GL7p.**2**xxx and GL7p.**3**xxx), the identification can also be transmitted wirelessly, e.g., via smartphone. The wireless interface can be enabled via the following option.

*Configuration > Application > Reader > BLE > General > BLE enabled*

- ► Select the option if you want to use the wireless interface.
- ► You can configure the wireless interface as required via the other fields in this window.

### *5.5.9 PIN-Code Keypad*

For GL7p variants with a PIN-code keypad (variants GL7p.**1**xxx and GL7p.**3**xxx), the identification can also be completed using a PIN code. To allow entry via PIN code, the following option must be enabled.

*Configuration > Application > Reader > KeyPad > General > KeyPad enabled*

- ► Select the option if you want to use the PIN-code keypad.
- ► Via the other fields in this window, you can specify the time within which a PIN code must be entered and set the permitted length of the PIN code.

*Table 5.1 – Configuration settings for the GL7p in GAT Config Manager* 

# 6 OPERATION

### *RF exposure statement*

*The users must keep at least 20 cm separation distance from the device, except during the identification and operation process at the device (e.g., PIN-code input), which must be performed as described in this manual.*

# **6.1 Target Group**

This chapter contains information for the technicians who commission the GL7p and who check it in case of operation problems.

# **6.2 General**

To operate the GL7p (e.g., to lock or unlock a locker), the user must identify themselves at the GL7p with their RFID data carrier or PIN code.

For identification via RFID data carrier, the button must be pressed in with the data carrier. Pressing the button activates the GL7p and the data carrier is read.

For identification via PIN code, the PIN code must be entered in order to lock or unlock the locker. After entering the PIN code, it is confirmed with the "✓" key or by pressing the push button. An RFID data carrier is then not necessary. The length of the PIN code is configurable. So that the personal PIN codes remain protected, the PIN codes entered are not recorded in the lock bookings and cannot be read.

![](_page_56_Picture_11.jpeg)

*To save battery power, the GL7p is deactivated in its normal state. For this reason, the electronics must be activated before identification or operation can occur using a data carrier, which is done by pressing the button completely in or by pressing one of the keypad buttons.*

An LED display and audible buzzer indicate the operational states and provide feedback on user interaction.

# **6.3 Operating Modes**

The GL7p can operate in "free locker" mode or "personal locker" mode. In free locker mode, the user can choose any unoccupied locker they want to use. In personal locker mode, the user is assigned a specific locker and only they have access to use the locker.

When free lockers and personal lockers are used together in one system, it is recommended that the locker numbers are unique for both functions. This means that the same locker number should not be used for both a personal locker and a free locker.

The following operating modes are possible:

"Free Locker" Operating Mode

- Free locker selection with or without duration of use function (default)
NOTE! The duration of use function for free locker mode is only available for MIFARE systems.

- Free locker universal
- Free locker unique number

![](_page_57_Picture_1.jpeg)

### "Personal Locker" Operating Mode

- Personal locker programming card

- Personal locker expiry date
Requirements for MIFARE, ISO 15693, and HID iClass data carriers

All MIFARE and ISO 15693 data carriers that are used in the system must meet the operating mode requirements as specified in the following table.

| Operating Mode                   | Requirements for Data Carriers                                                                    |
|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

| Free locker universal            | The locker segment must be unused (encoded with all zeros) and the<br>access keys must be correct |
| Free locker unique number        | All MIFARE, ISO 15693, and HID iClass data carriers are possible                                  |
| Personal locker programming card | All MIFARE, ISO 15693, and HID iClass data carriers are possible                                  |
| Personal locker expiry date      | Data carrier must be coded accordingly                                                            |

*Figure 6.1 – Requirements for data carriers*

### *6.3.1 Free Locker Mode (with or without Duration of Use Function)*

In free locker mode, the user has the option of selecting a free locker and locking it using their data carrier. After the locker has been locked, the user cannot occupy any additional lockers within the same locker group. Only once the original locker has been unlocked can the user lock another locker in the locker group.

Locker groups are used to organize the locks within a system into certain functional blocks, e.g., changing room lockers, safe-deposit boxes, etc. Different sector numbers are used on the data carriers to distinguish between the locker groups, which allows two or more lockers from different groups to be used with the same data carrier, depending on the data carrier storage space.

For data carriers that are configured with an expiry date, the date is checked by the GL7p. If the date has passed, the locker cannot be used.

NOTE! The GL7p does not automatically adjust to seasonal time changes. This must be considered when defining the validity or expiry date.

Locking and unlocking lockers with a data carrier

- ► Close the locker door.
- ► Press the button of the GL7p in using a data carrier for approximately 1 second.
	- o The information on the data carrier is read.
	- a) Valid data carrier: The LED flashes blue briefly and then green and the action (lock/unlock) is carried out.
	- b) Invalid data carrier: The LED flashes blue briefly and then red and the GL7p switches off without completing the locking action. Possible reasons for this include:
		- Another locker has already been locked using the data carrier. In this case, the first locker must be unlocked before the data carrier can be used with the new locker.
- ► When locking the locker, check that it is locked by pulling the locker door.

Locking and unlocking lockers with a PIN code

- ► Close the locker door.
- ► Enter your PIN code.

NOTE: The length of the PIN code can be defined in the configuration.

- ► Press the OK button (✓) or the button of the GL7p to confirm the PIN code.
	- o The PIN code is checked.
	- a) Valid PIN code: The LED flashes green briefly, and the action (lock/unlock) is carried out.
	- b) Invalid PIN code: The LED flashes red briefly and the GL7p switches off without completing the locking action.
- ► When locking the locker, check that it is locked by pulling the locker door.

### **Duration of Use Function**

Free locker mode also offers the possibility to define a duration of use for each locker. If a locker with this function is locked with a data carrier, the current time is written onto the data carrier and the time subsequently checked when the user attempts to open the locker again. With PIN code entry, this function is also possible. The timer resets after a new PIN code has been entered.

The locker can be locked/unlocked as often as required during the duration of use period. If the duration of use period is exceeded, the data carrier can no longer unlock the locker. In this case, the user must recode their data carrier at a central station, e.g., at a GAT Info or GT7 Terminal.

NOTE! The data carriers must be coded accordingly for the duration of use function (the corresponding config bits on the data carrier must be set). The GL7p must also be configured for the function (see section "5.5.4. [Duration of](#page--1-35)  [Use "](#page--1-35)). There are two configuration modes for the function:

- Absolute duration of use ("Duration" function)

In this mode, a usage period (depending on the "Time limit" parameter in minutes or hours, see ["5.5.10](#page--1-14) [Configuration Settings Table"](#page--1-14)) is configured. After locking a locker, the user must unlock the locker again within the defined period. The period begins from when the locker was first locked. Example:

The time is set to 360 minutes. If the locker is locked at 17:00, it can be unlocked until 23:00. If the locker is locked at 21:00, it can be unlocked until 03:00 of the next day. The duration of use time is reset after the locker remains open for 60 minutes.

- Use up to a specific time after midnight ("Point of time" function)

In this mode, a time is configured up to which the locker can be used every day. After locking a locker, the locker must be unlocked before the defined time. The usage period starts from the configured time after midnight. Example:

The time is set to 120 minutes. As the calculation begins at midnight, the locker can be used until 02:00 the following day regardless of when the locker was locked. If the locker is locked, e.g., at 01:00, it can be unlocked until 02:00 of the following day. If the locker remains locked past this time, the data carrier can no longer unlock the locker. In this case, the user must release the data carrier at a central station.

Locking and unlocking lockers with a data carrier

- ► Close the locker door.
- ► Press the button of the GL7p in using a data carrier for approximately 1 second.
	- o The information on the data carrier is read.
	- a) Valid data carrier: The LED flashes blue briefly and then green and the action (lock/unlock) is carried out. The time on the data carrier is checked and the current time written onto the data carrier.
	- b) Invalid data carrier: The LED flashes blue briefly and then red and the GL7p switches off without completing the locking action. Possible reasons for this include:
		- Another locker has already been locked using the data carrier. In this case, the first locker must be unlocked before the data carrier can be used with the new locker.
		- The duration of use period has been exceeded and the locker cannot be opened anymore. In this case, the data carrier must be reset at a central station.
- ► When locking the locker, check that it is locked by pulling the locker door.

### *6.3.2 Free Locker Universal Mode*

The "Free locker universal" operating mode differs from the standard free locker mode in the following ways:

- Free locker universal mode allows the use of data carriers that are also used for other applications.
- No validity date with free locker universal mode.
- It is not possible to use a duration of use time with free locker universal mode.
- The following requirements for the data carriers apply:
	- 1. The locker segment must be unused and "empty", i.e., coded with all zeros.
	- 2. The Access Keys must be correct.

- ► When locking the locker, check that it is locked by pulling the locker door.

### *6.3.4 Personal Locker Programming Card Mode*

For lockers operating in "personal locker programming card" mode, up to 32 data carriers and/or 32 PIN codes per GL7p can be authorized for use. These 32 data carriers and/or 32 PIN codes can be used with the locker as often as required and share the same authorization access, e.g., for use as family cards.

The data carriers are authorized for use with the personal locker using the PROGRAM data carrier (included in the GAT ECO.Basic Set, see section ["6.4](#page--1-0) [GAT ECO.Basic Set FD"](#page--1-0)).

### Authorizing data carriers

- ► Close the locker door.
- ► Press the button of the GL7p in using the PROGRAM data carrier for approximately 1 second.
	- o The information on the data carrier is read and the LED flashes green briefly.
- ► The GL7p enters into programming mode.
	- o The LED flashes red until the PROGRAM data carrier is removed. As soon as the PROGRAM data carrier has been removed, the LED flashes red/green and the lock is ready to program data carriers.
- ► Within 5 seconds, hold the data carrier being authorized in front of the GL7p button (the button does not need to be pressed).
	- a) Successful authorization: The LED flashes green for approximately 3 seconds. When the data carrier is removed, the LED flashes red/green alternately again and another data carrier can be authorized in the same way. Repeat this process until all the data carriers are authorized.
	- b) Unsuccessful authorization: The LED flashes red and the GL7p switches off. Possible reasons for this include:
		- The maximum of 32 data carriers are already authorized in the GL7p.
		- The data carrier could not be read correctly, e.g., because the data carrier is damaged.
- ► You can repeat the last step using different data carriers to program these data carriers successively. To do this, each data carrier being authorized must be held in front of the GL7p button within 5 seconds after removing the previous data carrier. If you wait longer than 5 seconds, the reading process is terminated, and the read data carriers are saved in the lock.

### Authorizing PIN codes

- ► Close the locker door.
- ► Press the button of the GL7p in using the PROGRAM data carrier for approximately 1 second.
	- o The information on the data carrier is read and the LED flashes green briefly.
- ► The GL7p enters into programming mode.
	- o The LED flashes red until the PROGRAM data carrier is removed. As soon as the PROGRAM data carrier has been removed, the LED flashes red/green and the lock is ready to program data carriers.
- ► Within 5 seconds, enter the PIN code being authorized and confirm with the OK key (✓) or by pressing the push button.
	- a) Successful authorization: The LED flashes green for approximately 3 seconds. When the data carrier is removed, the LED flashes red/green alternately again and another PIN code can be authorized in the same way. Repeat this process until all the PIN codes are authorized.
	- b) Unsuccessful authorization: The LED flashes red 3 times and the GL7p switches off. Possible reasons for this include:
		- The maximum of 32 PIN codes are already authorized in the GL7p.
		- The PIN code was not correctly entered, e.g., the PIN code was too short or too long or an invalid PIN code was entered.

- ► You can repeat the last step using different PIN codes to program these successively. To do this, the PIN code must be entered within 5 seconds after confirming the previous PIN code. If you wait longer than 5 seconds, the reading process is terminated, and the PIN codes are saved in the lock.
### Deleting data carriers or PIN codes (= removing authorization)

It is only possible to delete all authorizations in the GL7p at once.

- ► Close the locker door and hold it shut.
- ► Press the button of the GL7p in using the PROGAM data carrier for approximately 1 second.
	- o The information on the data carrier is read and the LED flashes green briefly.
- ► The GL7p enters into programming mode.
	- o The LED flashes red until the PROGRAM data carrier is removed. As soon as the PROGRAM data carrier has been removed, the LED flashes red/green and the lock is ready for the next step.
- ► Within 5 seconds, press the button of the GL7p in using the PROGRAM data carrier for approximately 1 second.
- ► When the action is successful, the LED flashes red 3 times and 2 beeps are emitted. The GL7p then switches off.
	- o All data carriers and PIN codes are now deleted from the GL7p and no longer have the authorization to use the locker.

### *6.3.5 Personal Locker Expiry Date Mode*

During check-in, the user receives a data carrier encoded with GANTNER data blocks. The FID is written onto the "general" data block and the user's personal locker number together with the expiry date ("valid from" and "valid to") are written onto the "locker" data block of the data carrier. Furthermore, an index value is written onto the "locker" data block. The "valid from" date must always be valid, i.e., equal to or after the date set in the GL7p.

This mode is only possible with RFID data carriers and not with PIN code entry as the PIN codes cannot be used to save a validity date.

Upon first use of a locker, the expiry date ("valid to" date) and the current index value of the data carrier are stored in the lock. The guest can lock and unlock the locker as required, starting from the "valid from" date and for as long as the expiry date is not reached or exceeded.

NOTE! The GL7p does not adjust to daylight saving time automatically. This must be considered when evaluating events and authorizing data carriers with an expiry date.

![](_page_63_Picture_1.jpeg)

An unlimited number of data carriers (users) can use the same locker. The following conditions apply to the data carriers in this mode:

- The same locker number must be stored on the data carriers.
- The same expiry date must be stored on the data carriers.
- The same index value must be stored on the data carriers.

When one of the data carriers assigned to a user is used at the locker for the first time, the expiry date and the index value of the data carrier are transferred to the GL7p.

### Locking and unlocking lockers

- ► Close the locker door.
- ► Press the button of the GL7p in using the data carrier for approximately 1 second.
	- o The information on the data carrier is read. The locker number on the data carrier must correspond with the locker number in the lock.
- ► The following situations are possible. The data carrier ...
	- 1) … is the first data carrier used at the locker:
		- o The index value and the "valid to" date of the data carrier are saved in the lock. The data carrier can lock and unlock the locker until the end of the validity period.
	- 2) …has the same index value and "valid to" date as stored in the lock:
		- o The data carrier is now authorized to lock and unlock the locker like the previously authorized data carriers.
	- 3) …has a higher index value than in the lock:
		- o The new index value and the "valid to" date of the data carrier are saved in the lock. The data carriers previously authorized in the lock lose their validity, i.e., they are no longer authorized to use the locker.
	- 4) …has the same index value and a newer "valid to" date than in the lock:
		- o The index value and the new "valid to" date of the data carrier are saved in the lock. The data carriers previously authorized in the lock lose their validity, i.e., they are no longer authorized to use the locker.

NOTE! Situation 2) is possible when the locker is locked or unlocked. Situations 3) and 4) are possible with a locked or unlocked locker except when the "PersonalLockerSecureFlag" option is set (see ["5.5.10](#page--1-14) [Configuration](#page--1-14)  [Settings Table"](#page--1-14)). With this option set, the procedure is only possible with an open (unlocked) locker.

- ► Release the locker door.
	- a) Valid data carriers: The locker state will switch, i.e., the locker will open when it was locked or will lock when it was open.
	- b) Invalid data carriers: The LED flashes red briefly and the GL7p switches off without carrying out an action.

There is also no unlimited usage period for the locker, i.e., the expiry date must be a valid date (not "0"). If the "valid to" date is exceeded, the locker can no longer be opened using the data carrier except when the "LastOpenAtExpiredDate" option is set (see ["5.5.10](#page--1-14) [Configuration Settings Table"](#page--1-14)). With this option set, the locker can be opened one more time using the data carrier.

![](_page_64_Picture_22.jpeg)

*Over the following pages, the Basic Set is referred to as "GAT ECO.Basic Set".*

# **6.5 Summary of System Data Carriers**

The data carriers included in the GAT ECO.Basic Set are required to configure and maintain a GL7p equipped locker system.

![](_page_64_Picture_26.jpeg)

*The system data carriers are coded to function with specific installations and will only function with the respective system.*

### *6.5.1 MASTER Data Carrier*

With a MASTER data carrier, all locks in a system can be unlocked and locked. If a user's data carrier is lost, an emergency opening of the corresponding locker can be carried out using a MASTER data carrier. Three MASTER data carriers are included in the basic set and they are only valid for the respective system.

NOTE! The system operator must ensure that the MASTER data carriers are stored in a safe and secure location.

If a MASTER data carrier is lost, a new MASTER data carrier can be ordered from GANTNER Electronic GmbH. Before the new MASTER data carrier is used, the original MASTER data carriers must be deleted from the GL7p (the number of a MASTER data carrier is stored in the lock the first time the MASTER data carrier is used). This is carried out using the DELETE MASTER data carrier. Complete the following procedure:

- ► Press the locker door shut.
- ► Press the button of the GL7p in using the DELETE MASTER data carrier for approximately 1 second.
	- o The information on the data carrier is read and the LED flashes red until the DELETE MASTER data carrier is removed.
- ► Remove the DELETE MASTER data carrier from the button.
	- o All MASTER data carriers are now deleted from the lock. Next, the LED flashes green and red alternately and the new MASTER data carriers can be programmed.
- ► Within 5 seconds, press the button of the GL7p in using the first MASTER data carrier for approximately 1 second.
	- o When the data carrier is read correctly, the LED flashes green for 2 seconds.
- ► Remove the MASTER data carrier from the button.
	- o The LED flashes green and red alternately. The second MASTER data carrier can now be programmed.
- ► Repeat the process until all MASTER data carriers are programmed.
- ► If no action occurs after 5 seconds during programming of the MASTER data carriers, the GL7p automatically returns to the normal operating mode and the new MASTER data carriers are saved in the lock.

### *6.5.2 OPEN MASTER Data Carrier (Optional Accessory)*

The OPEN MASTER data carriers can unlock any GL7p in a system. If a user's data carrier is lost, an emergency opening of the corresponding locker can be carried out using an OPEN MASTER data carrier. Compared to the MASTER data carrier, the OPEN MASTER data carrier cannot lock the locker after it has been opened. The OPEN MASTER data carrier is not included in the Basic Set and must be ordered separately as required. This data carrier is only valid for the respective system.

NOTE! The system operator must ensure that the OPEN MASTER data carriers are stored in a safe location that is secured against unauthorized access.

An OPEN MASTER data carrier can be used instead of an original MASTER data carrier. To program the OPEN MASTER data carrier into a lock, read the data carrier at the lock. If already the max. amount of MASTER data carriers (10) are programmed into the lock, the MASTER data carriers must first be deleted and the OPEN MASTER data carrier must be programmed together with the required MASTER data carriers (max. total amount of 10).

### *6.5.3 DELETE MASTER Data Carrier*

The DELETE MASTER data carrier is used to delete all the MASTER data carriers stored in the GL7p. See section "6.5.1. MASTER [Data Carrier"](#page--1-47).

### *6.5.4 PROGRAM Data Carrier*

For locks operating in personal locker mode, the PROGRAM data carrier is used to authorize data carriers so that they can be used with the locker. The PROGRAM data carrier is also used to delete the existing authorizations of personal lockers. See section ["6.3.4](#page--1-14) [Personal Locker Programming Card](#page--1-14) Mode".

### *6.5.5 BATTERY Data Carrier*

After the batteries are replaced in the GL7p, the lock must be set back to the normal operating mode using the BATTERY data carrier. The internal action counter is reset to zero when the BATTERY data carrier is used. See section "4.2.3. [Replacing the Battery"](#page--1-25) for more information.

![](_page_66_Picture_4.jpeg)

*After replacing the battery of a GL7p in personal locker mode, all settings stored in the lock remain as previously configured.*

### *6.5.6 SERVICE Data Carrier*

The SERVICE data carrier is used to put the GL7p into configuration mode after the lock is connected to a computer via USB (see section "4.3 USB [Connection"](#page--1-26)). The settings of the GL7p are configured using GAT Config Manager while the lock is in configuration mode (see "6. [CONFIGURATION"](#page--1-0)).

NOTE! The SERVICE data carrier must be available for service employees who are required to configure the locker system. Without the SERVICE data carrier, system configuration is not possible!

### *6.5.7 APP KEY Data Carrier*

The APP KEY data carrier is required to configure the GL7p using the MoLA app. This app can be installed on mobile devices with an Android operating system. When the lock is in factory mode and configured for the first time, the APP KEY is not needed. For subsequent configuration changes however the APP KEY data carrier is required (see also ["5.4. Configuration with the MoLA App"](#page--1-14)).

![](_page_66_Picture_11.jpeg)

*To configure the GL7p with GAT Config Manager, the APP KEY data carrier is not required.* 

### *6.5.8 BLOCKING Data Carrier (Optional Accessory)*

This data carrier is used to block a locker which is locked by a user. After using the BLOCKING data carrier at the locker, the user cannot open the locker anymore. To open the locker, a MASTER data carrier must be used. The automatic open function will be disabled after the BLOCKING data carrier is used until the lock is opened with a MASTER or OPEN MASTER data carrier.

The BLOCKING data carrier is not included in the scope of supply of the GAT ECO.Basic Set and can be ordered as an accessory. This data carrier is only valid for the assigned system.

# **6.6 Summary of GL7p Signalization**

The electronics of the GL7p are activated when the lock button is pressed in. The activation is signaled by the LED at the top of the GL7p (LED flashes blue). Immediately thereafter, the following lock states are signaled by the LED and the integrated beeper.

| LED                   | Beeper                 | Meaning                                                                                      |

# 7 CLEANING AND MAINTENANCE

This chapter contains information for the cleaning personnel and service technicians responsible for the cleaning and maintenance of the GL7p locks and lockers.

ATTENTION! The instructions described in this chapter may only be carried out by suitably trained personnel. The warnings in this chapter must be observed and followed during functional testing, cleaning, and maintenance.

# **7.1 Cleaning**

Regular cleaning of the locker components ensures that the locker system remains in good condition and the correct working order is maintained.

NOTE! Do not use cleaning benzene, diluents, or other abrasive detergents. In addition, the components must not be cleaned using a high-pressure or steam cleaner otherwise damage can occur!

Complete the following steps to clean the locker:

- ► Wipe off dirt and dust using a soft, lint-free, dry cloth.
- ► For extreme dirt, clean the locker components using a slightly moistened cloth. Do not allow any moisture to enter the inner parts of the GL7p.

# **7.2 Maintenance**

The GL7p system components are maintenance-free, i.e., maintenance of the mechanical parts is not required. Should a malfunction be detected during functional testing that cannot be remedied, the corresponding faulty part(s) must be replaced.

# **7.3 Functional Testing**

To ensure that the locker locks are functioning correctly, periodically test the functionality of the locker doors and lock components.

### **Frequency**

- After every 1000 locking operations, or,
- If the locking function of a locker door is impaired.

### **Instructions**

- ► Close the locker door.
	- o The door must close shut without increased effort. Readjust the door (see below) if this does not happen.
- ► Lock the door. Depending on the type of lock (data carrier or PIN code), press the GL7p button in with a valid data carrier or enter a valid PIN code when the door is closed.
	- o The locker door must lock. If it does not, check that the data carrier authorization is valid.

![](_page_69_Picture_1.jpeg)

- ► Unlock the door. Depending on the type of lock (data carrier or PIN code), press the GL7p button in with a valid data carrier or enter a valid PIN code when the door is locked.
	- o The locker door unlocks and must open without resistance. If the door or latch jams, re-adjust the door or latch (see below).
- ► Check that the latch is firmly seated on the mounting thread.

### **Adjusting the locker door and door latch**

If a problem, as described previously in "Instructions", occurs while opening or closing the locker door during functional testing:

- ► Adjust the position of the locker door using the dimensions in sections ["3.8](#page--1-14) Installation [of the GL7p"](#page--1-14) and ["8.9](#page--1-0) [Dimensions"](#page--1-0).
- ► If the door does not adjust properly, mount it in a different position.
- ► If the door is damaged, replace the door with a new door.
- ► Ensure that the correct latch is installed so that it sits exactly against the stop on the locker wall when the door closed and keeps the door closed without any play. See sections ["3.8](#page--1-14) Installation [of the GL7p"](#page--1-14) and ["8.9](#page--1-0) [Dimensions"](#page--1-0).
- ► If the supplied standard latch does not suit the locker wall (e.g., when retrofitting), a corresponding offset latch can be ordered. The standard latch must not be bent or modified in any way.
- ► If the latch is damaged, it must be replaced.

# **7.4 Disposal**

![](_page_69_Picture_14.jpeg)

- Do not dispose of the GL7p and the associated components with the normal household waste, but rather at your local electronic waste recycling facility in accordance with European Directive 2002/96/EC.
- Recycle defective or used batteries according to European Directive 2006/66/EC.
- Observe local regulations for the separate disposal of batteries.
- Recycle packaging in an environmentally friendly manner.
