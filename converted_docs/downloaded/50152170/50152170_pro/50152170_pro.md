Keep your security in focus with the many features of the AUTODOME IP starlight 5000i IR camera. The camera is carefully tuned to deliver detailed, 1080p60 HD images during the day as well as full details in lowlight or no-light conditions. The integrated, intelligent IR illuminator automatically adjusts the IR intensity according to zoom factor and field of view to ensure that the scene is illuminated uniformly.

#### **Functions**

# **See in the dark**

The camera's smart, variable IR illumination technology from Bosch produces outstanding video on a per-zone basis in low-light scenes. This configuration ensures that each scene receives the appropriate illumination intensity and avoids focus instability from mixed lighting conditions.

# **Low-light performance**

The latest sensor technology, combined with sophisticated noise suppression and a High dynamic range of 120 dB, results in an exceptional sensitivity in color. The camera continues to provide excellent color performance even with a minimum of ambient light.

- Vibrant: For enhanced contrast, sharpness, and saturation
- Number Plate scene mode: For the best image to be used by ANPR software.

# **H.265 high-efficiency video encoding**

The camera is designed on the most efficient and powerful H.264 and H.265/HEVC encoding platform. The camera is capable of delivering high-quality and high-resolution video with very low network load. With a doubling of encoding efficiency, H.265 is the new compression standard of choice for IP video surveillance systems.

#### **Intelligent streaming**

Smart encoding capabilities, together with Intelligent Dynamic Noise Reduction technology and analytics, make the bandwidth consumption drop to extremely

low levels. Only relevant information in the scene, such as motion or objects found with the analytics, are encoded.

#### **Support for H.264 and H.265 with Encoder Regions**

Set a region in the field of view and define a specific encoder profile to it. This setting reduces the bitrate of the stream further than intelligent streaming alone.

### **Recording and storage management**

Recording management can be controlled by the Bosch Video Recording Manager application, or the camera can use local storage and iSCSI targets directly without any recording software. A memory card with a maximum of 32 GB (microSDHC) / 2 TB (microSDXC) can be used for recording "at the edge" or for Automatic Network

Replenishment (ANR) technology to improve the overall recording reliability.

Pre-alarm recording in RAM reduces bandwidth consumption on the network and extends the effective life of the memory card.

#### **Stratocast™ service from Genetec**

The camera provides Stratocast service, which records video in the cloud, eliminating the need to install servers on-site.

#### **Essential Video Analytics on the edge**

The camera includes the latest release of Essential Video Analytics application from Bosch for use on Pre-positions.

The Essential Video Analytics application provides reliable video analytics for small and medium business, large retail stores, commercial buildings, and warehouses.

Advanced tasks like multiple line crossing, loitering, idle / removed object detection, crowd density estimation, occupancy and people counting are available for live alarming and forensic search. Object filters based on size, speed, direction, aspect ratio, and color can be defined.

A simplified calibration mode reduces installation time significantly, because you only need to enter the installation height once for each camera, independent of pre-positions.

After the camera is calibrated, the analytics engine can automatically classify objects as upright person, car, bike, or truck.

#### **Sophisticated alarm responses**

The camera supports advanced alarm control that uses sophisticated rules-based logic to determine how to manage alarms. In its most basic form, a "rule" could define which input(s) should activate which output(s). In a more complex form, inputs and outputs can be combined with pre-defined or user-specified commands to perform advanced camera functions.

#### **Superior privacy masking**

The camera allows for a total of 32 individual privacy masks, with up to eight masks displayed in the same scene. Each mask can be programmed with eight corners. Each mask changes size and shape smoothly and quickly, ensuring that the covered object cannot be seen.

With the AUTO Privacy Mask, the color of the Privacy Mask will adapt to the color of the surroundings.

#### **DORI coverage**

DORI (Detect, Observe, Recognize, Identify) is a standard system (EN-62676-4) for defining the ability of a camera to distinguish persons or objects within a covered area. The maximum distance at which a camera/lens combination can meet these criteria is shown below:

|           | DORI       | Distance |           |
|-----------|------------|----------|-----------|
|           | definition | WIDE 1X  | TELE 30X  |
| Detect    | 25 px/m    | 65 m     | 1833 m    |
|           | (8 px/ft)  | (213 ft) | (6014 ft) |
| Observe   | 63 px/m    | 26 m     | 727 m     |
|           | (19 px/ft) | (85 ft)  | (2385 ft) |
| Recognize | 125 px/m   | 13 m     | 367 m     |
|           | (38 px/ft) | (43 ft)  | (1204 ft) |
| Identify  | 250 px/m   | 7 m      | 183 m     |
|           | (76 px/ft) | (23 ft)  | (600 ft)  |

#### **Data security**

Special measures are necessary to ensure the highest level of security for device access and data transport. On initial setup, the camera is only accessible over secure channels. You must set a service-level password in order to access camera functions. Web browser and viewing client access can be protected using HTTPS or other secure protocols that support state-of-the-art TLS 1.2 protocol with updated cipher suites including AES encryption with 256 bit keys. No software can be installed in the camera, and only authenticated firmware can be uploaded. A threelevel password protection with security recommendations allows users to customize device access. Network and device access can be protected using 802.1x network authentication with EAP/TLS protocol. Superior protection from malicious attacks is guaranteed by the Embedded Login Firewall, on-board Trusted Platform Module (TPM) and Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) support.

The advanced certificate handling offers:

- Self-signed unique certificates automatically created when required
- Client and server certificates for authentication
- Client certificates for proof of authenticity
- Certificates with encrypted private keys

#### **Software sealing**

If the end user requests, the camera's configurator can enable software protection, called software sealing, that prevents users from adjusting camera settings. This function also protects the camera from unauthorized access.

#### **System integration and ONVIF conformance**

The camera conforms to the ONVIF Profile S, ONVIF Profile G, and ONVIF Profile T specifications. For H. 265 configuration, the camera supports Media Service 2, which is part of ONVIF Profile T. Compliance with these standards guarantees interoperability between network video products regardless of manufacturer. Third-party integrators can easily access the internal feature set of the camera for integration into large projects. Visit the Bosch Integration Partner Program (IPP) website (ipp.boschsecurity.com) for more information.

#### **PTZ drive and mechanism**

The camera supports 256 pre-positions and two styles of Guard Tours: Pre-position and Record/Playback. The Pre-position tour has capability for up to 256 prepositions with a configurable dwell time between prepositions and can be customized as to the order and the frequency that each Pre-position is visited. The camera also provides support for two (2) recorded tours, which have a total duration of 15 minutes of movements. These are recorded macros of an operator's movements, including pan, tilt, and zoom activities, and can be played back in a continuous manner.

Pan and tilt preset repeatability are accurate to within ±0.1 degrees to ensure that the correct scene is captured every time. The camera delivers maximum pan speed of 240 degrees per second and maximum tilt speed of 160° degrees per second. The camera is capable of manual speeds (pan and tilt) of 0.1 to 120 degrees per second. The camera provides a pan range of up to 360 degrees continuous rotation.

#### **Snap to zoom**

Drawing a box in the image will trigger the camera to zoom to the correct position.

#### **Ease of installation and servicing**

The camera has been designed for quick and easy installation, a key feature from Bosch IP video security products.

Bosch designed the camera with the knowledge that field cables and mounts are installed before the camera is mounted. The installation concept allows a single person to connect the cables directly to the camera without re-routing cables. The camera is easily secured to the mount with a single screw. The camera is rated to provide IP66 protection and offer an operating temperature range down to -40 °C (-40 °F). The housing comes fully assembled with a sunshield and ready for wall or pipe applications with the proper mounting hardware (sold separately).

#### **Project Assistant**

Project Assistant by Bosch is the market's most easyto-use app for initial installation and basic configuration of IP cameras. Off-site and without connection to the camera, basic configurations can already be covered and shared with colleagues. Onsite, these pre-configurations can simply be pushed onto the camera, making the installation procedure easier and less time consuming. Already configured cameras can be integrated as well. The app allows easy viewing and adjustment of the camera's field of view. The app automatically generates a comprehensive report of the commissioned cameras.
