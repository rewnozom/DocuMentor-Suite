# OUTDOOR OPTICAL ACOUSTIC ALARM DEVICE

TL 30

TL 30 is an optical-acoustic alarm device for outdoor use. It can be connected in self-supplied mode and with external supply source.

TL 30 is equipped with a high-brightness LED flashing device and a high-power speaker. Moreover, it features microprocessor controlled board and anti-removal tamper protection against any attempts of opening the sounder cover and detaching the device from the installation surface.

The 5-way dipswitch bar enables the selection and setting of different functions to suit any alarm systems and the board is protected against reverse polarity and tropicalized through a special resin treatment to resist even in very severe, humid or cold environments.
