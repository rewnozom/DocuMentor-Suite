#### **4.2.1.1.1 Zone State**

The device will automatically start to scan the network for an IAS Zone client in a predefine interval. When the client is found it will automatically attempt to enrol. When it has successfully enrolled the Zone Status command is send every 5 minutes.

The attribute value will change from not enrolled (0x00) to Enrolled (0x01)

#### **4.2.1.1.2 IAS CIE Address**

Attribute specifies the address that commands generated by the server shall be sent to.

To un-enroll the device the back end system has to write a new address into this attribute. Any value is valid. If the back end system writes an IEEE adr then it will try to enrol to this devices represented by the IEEE adr.

#### **4.2.1.1.3 ZoneID**

A unique reference number allocated by the CIE at zone enrollment time.

Used by IAS devices to reference specific zones when communicating with the CIE. The ZoneID of each zone stays fixed until that zone is unenrolled

#### **4.2.1.2 Commands**

The IAS Zone cluster has 2 commands as server.

Init sequence – when the device has join the network it start to scan for an IAS zone client cluster. If a client is found a Zone enroll request command is send and a Zone Enroll response is expected. If it doesn't receive a response within 15 sec it gives up and will continue to scan x number of attempts. When the init sequence is over it will enter a state where it scans for a client every 12 hour.

The following bits are supported in Zone status: Bit0: Alarm 1 Bit3: Battery Bit4: Supervision reports Bit5: Restore reports Bit8: Test

When the battery is below **2.8 VDC** Bit3: Battery is set high and "Zone Status" is transmitted to the coordinator.

## **4.2.2 Power Configuration - Cluster id 0x0001**

The power configuration cluster is described in ZigBee Cluster Library Specification

#### **4.2.2.1 Attribute**

| Id#    | Name           | Type  | Range       | Man/Opt | Relevance and ref.         |
|--------|----------------|-------|-------------|---------|----------------------------|
| 0x0020 | BatteryVoltage | Uint8 | 0x00 - 0xFF | O       | ZCL configure reporting is |
|        |                |       |             |         | supported                  |

Note: The attribute "*BatteryVoltage*" is measuring the battery voltage, in units of 100mV.

## **4.2.3 Poll Control - Cluster id 0x0020**

The poll control cluster is described in ZigBee Cluster Library Specification

This cluster provides a mechanism for the management of an end device's MAC Data Request rate. For the purposes of this cluster, the term "poll" always refers to the sending of a MAC Data Request from the end device to the end device's parent.

This cluster can be used for instance by a configuration device to make an end device responsive for a certain period of time so that the device can be managed by the controller.

#### **4.2.3.1 Attribute**

| Id#    | Name               | Type   | Range       | Man/Opt | Relevance and ref.           |
|--------|--------------------|--------|-------------|---------|------------------------------|
| 0x0000 | Check-inInterval   | Uint32 | 0x00 - 0xFF | M       | Default value is 1 hour      |
| 0x0001 | LongPoll Interval  | Uint32 |             | M       | Default value is 7.5 seconds |
| 0x0002 | ShortPollIntervall | Uint16 |             | M       | Default value is 1 seconds   |
| 0x0003 | FastPollTimeout    | Uint16 |             | M       | Default value is 5 minutes   |

Start up, auto scan for client poll control cluster on the coordinator. If it is support on the coordinator an auto bind is created and the smoke sensor will send a check-in command in the interval specified in attribute "CheckinInterval. The coordinator has to reply with a check-in response. The sensor supports the following commands send from the client (Typically the coordinator).

- 0x00 Check-in Response,
- 0x01 Fast Poll Stop,

- 0x02 Set Long Poll Interval,
- 0x03 Set Short Poll Interval,

If it doesn't find a poll client it will search again periodically.

Using this cluster, a ZigBee device can access a ZigBee enabled IAS WD device and issue alarm warning indications (Smoke siren) when a system alarm condition is detected.

#### **4.2.4.1 Attribute**

| Id#    | Name        | Type   | Range      | Man/Opt | Relevance and ref. |
|--------|-------------|--------|------------|---------|--------------------|
| 0x0000 | MaxDuration | Uint16 | Type range | M       | Default is 240 sec |

The *MaxDuration* attribute specifies the maximum time in seconds that the siren will sound continuously, regardless of start/stop commands.

#### **4.2.4.2 Commands**

The IAS WD cluster has 1 command as server.

| Id#  | Name          | Man/Opt | Relevance and ref. |
|------|---------------|---------|--------------------|
| 0x00 | Start warning | M       |                    |

#### **4.2.4.2.1 Command - Start warning**

This command starts the WD operation. The WD alerts the surrounding area by audible (siren).

The *Start Warning* command payload shall be formatted as illustrated

| Command Data     | Size   | Description             |  |  |
|------------------|--------|-------------------------|--|--|
| Warning          | 1 byte | 0 = Siren off           |  |  |
|                  |        | 1 = Siren On            |  |  |
| Warning duration | 2 byte | Warning duration is sec |  |  |

Note: The start warning command doesn't set the alarm bit in the IAS Zone status. The alarm is only triggered if the devices detect smoke or fire.

## **4.2.5 OTA Upgrade - Cluster id 0x0019**

The cluster provides a ZigBee standard way to upgrade devices in the network via OTA messages. The devices support the client side of the cluster.

When the devices has joined a network it will automatically auto scan for a OTA upgrade server in the network. If it finds a server an auto bind is created and ones every 24 hour it will automatically send its "current file version" to the OTA upgrade server. It is the server that initiate the firmware upgrade process.

# **5 MMI user guide**

## **5.1 Push Button Menu**

Pushing the button on a device provides the user with several possibilities.

Pushing the button for longer (push, hold for a few seconds, and release) allows the user to set the device into a desired mode. A mode change happens at 5 second interval. Below, these modes are illustrated in a state chart.

![](_page_16_Figure_5.jpeg)

When cycling through the menu modes, the state is indicated by a number of 100ms blinks on the LED. The device is supporting the ZigBee standardized EZ- mode Commissioning.

## **5.1.1 EZ mode - Initiator**

If the devices is not on the network EZ-Mode Network Steering is invoked when the user enter this menu. The led blinks once every 1 sec until the devices has joined the network. If the device was already on the network it will broadcast the PermitJoin messages. It is the trust center policy that decides if the device is allowed to join the network.

When the device has joined the network EZ-Mode Finding and Binding is invoked and the device start to blink every 3 sec until a cluster match is found. When a match is found or the cluster examine is finished the blinking stops and the device sends a messages to the target device to stop the identify time.

The following clusters are support in EZ-mode finding and binding:

- Temperature cluster
- Power configuration cluster
The EZ-mode time is hard coded to 3 minutes. This is the Minimum and recommended PermitJoin time broadcast for EZ-Mode Network Steering and minimum IdentifyTime set for EZ-Mode Finding and Binding. If the user enters the menu again another 3 minutes is started.

## **5.1.2 EZ mode - Target**

If the devices is not on the network EZ-Mode Network Steering is invoked when the user enter this menu. The led blinks twice every 1 sec until the devices has joined the network. If the device was already on the network it will broadcast the PermitJoin messages. It is the trust center policy that decides if the device is allowed to join the network.

When the device has joined the network identify mode is invoke and the device start to blink twice every 3 sec until identify mode is stopped or after the EZ-mode time has expired. If the user enters the menu again another 3 minutes is started.

## **5.1.3 Factory reset**

To allow a device to join a network, one either has to power up a device that has not previously joined a network or push the button until the Reset To Factory default mode is indicated – and subsequently release the button. This will cause the device to reset to its factory default state and scan for a suitable coordinator.

## **5.2 Action on Power On**

As a general rule, all end devices and routers that have not previously joined a network (or have been reset to factory default) will start up and search for a network with join permit open. In this mode, the LED will flash once every second.

Once the device has joined the network, is will start scanning for an OTA server, Time server, Poll control client and an IAS Zone client.

If a device has joined a network and is powered down, it will attempt to rejoin this network upon power up. For the first 30 seconds hereafter, the device will be available for communication. This time can be expanded using the poll control cluster functionality.

# **6 General network behaviour**

## **6.1 Installation**

When the device is virgin and powered for the first time it will start looking for a ZigBee PAN Coordinator or router to join. The device will scan each ZigBee channel starting from 11 to 24. The LED will flash once every second until it joins a device.

| #Scan mode - 1                       | #Sleep mode                    | #Scan mode - 2                  | #Sleep mode                    | #Scan mode - 2                  |
|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------|---------------------------------|

| channels until join<br>network or 15 | mode (Radio off)<br>15 minutes | ch x 1 or until join<br>network | mode (Radio off)<br>15 minutes | ch x 1 or until join<br>network |
| minutes                              |                                | ~ 30 seconds                    |                                | ~ 30 seconds                    |

The device will start up using scan mode 1. To increase battery lifetime when the device is joining a network for the first time a scan mode 2 will be used after scan mode 1 has expired. Scan mode 1 it will only be executed one time when the device is powered. If the user invokes EZ-mode it will start scanning the next 3 minutes

In section 5 "MMI" it is explained how to put the device into a join or leave network mode.

Network settings are stored in NV-memory are after a power cycle the device re-join the same network.

If the device has to join a new PAN coordinator the MMI menu supports a **"Reset To Factory Fresh Settings"** mode. This will erase all current network information.

## **6.2 Normal – Keep alive**

The device is sending a "keep alive" message to the PAN coordinator every 15 minute to verify that the device is still connected to the network.

## **6.2.1 Network lost**

If no "keep alive" responses are received 5 times in a row (Worst case 1h15m), the devices will start scanning as specified in the table below.

When the device is in scan mode the LED will flash once every second until it re-joins the network.

According to the ZigBee specification TX is NOT allowed to be enabled all the time and a TX silent period has to be defined.
