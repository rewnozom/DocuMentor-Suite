The SIM card slots, power, and Ethernet sockets should match accurately and fit the corresponding sockets, and the power button should not be stuck.

Check the information about input voltage on the device body to avoid incorrect power connections in the future. Use the special bundled sticker with the instruction.

- **10.** Connect the power (and Ethernet cable) to the appropriate sockets.

Switch on the device, wait until loading, and check the external power status in the Ajax app. If there is no power, and you are using a terminal adapter, check the polarity of the power cable. If there is no power even after reconnecting, please . **contact the Support Service**

> We recommend using zinc-air alkaline batteries for long-term autonomous operation. Before connecting such a battery, make sure that all the stickers have been removed, and valves capping the air access are open. If possible, leave the battery with access to air for up to 2 hours. This will start a chemical reaction inside and ensure proper functioning.
