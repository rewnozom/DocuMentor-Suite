#### **High Dynamic Range**

The camera has High Dynamic Range. This is based on a multiple-exposure process that captures more details in the highlights and in the shadows even in the same scene. The result is that you can easily distinguish objects and features, for example, faces with bright backlight.

The actual dynamic range of the camera is measured using Opto-Electronic Conversion Function (OECF) analysis according to IEC 62676 Part 5. This method is used to provide a standard result which can be used to compare different cameras.

#### **Content Based Imaging Technology**

Content Based Imaging Technology (CBIT) is used to radically improve image quality in all lighting conditions and to identify areas for enhanced processing. The camera examines the scene using Intelligent Video Analytics and provides feedback to retune the image processing. This provides better detail in the areas that matter and better all-round performance. With IVA, the Intelligent Auto Exposure technology, for example, allows you to view moving objects in bright and dark areas of a scene.

#### **Intelligent Video Analytics**

The built-in video analytics is both robust and intelligent. The Intelligence-at-the-Edge concept now delivers even more powerful features:

- Simple calibration
- False alarm reduction
- Extended range identification
- Crowd and queue management
- Density and flow counting

The mission critical video analytics reliably detects, tracks, and analyzes objects, and alerts you when predefined alarms are triggered. A smart set of alarm rules, together with object filters and tracking modes, makes complex tasks easy.

The system is also extremely robust and is able to reduce false alarms, for example from foliage or shaking objects, even in harsh weather conditions. Metadata is attached to your video to add sense and structure. This enables you to quickly retrieve the relevant images from hours of stored video. Metadata can also be used to deliver irrefutable forensic evidence or to optimize business processes based on people counting or crowd density information. Calibration is quick and easy – just enter the height of the camera. The internal gyro/accelerometer sensor provides the rest of the information to precisely calibrate the video analytics.

#### **Intelligent Dynamic Noise Reduction reduces bandwidth and storage requirements**

The camera uses Intelligent Dynamic Noise Reduction which actively analyzes the contents of a scene and reduces noise artifacts accordingly. The low-noise image and the efficient H.264 compression technology provide clear images while reducing bandwidth and storage by up to 50% compared to other H.264 cameras. This results in reduced-bandwidth streams that still retain a high image quality and smooth motion. The camera provides the most usable image possible by cleverly optimizing the detail-to-bandwidth ratio.

#### **Area-based encoding**

Area-based encoding is another feature which reduces bandwidth. Compression parameters for up to eight user-definable regions can be set. This allows uninteresting regions to be highly compressed, leaving more bandwidth for important parts of the scene.

#### **Bitrate optimized profile**

The average typical optimized bandwidth in kbits/s for various image rates is shown in the table.

| IPS | 1080p | 720p | 480p |
|-----|-------|------|------|
| 60  | 1900  | 1400 | 722  |
| 30  | 1600  | 1200 | 600  |
| 15  | 1274  | 955  | 478  |
| 12  | 1169  | 877  | 438  |

| IPS | 1080p | 720p | 480p |
|-----|-------|------|------|
| 5   | 757   | 568  | 284  |
| 2   | 326   | 245  | 122  |

#### **Multiple streams**

The innovative multi-streaming feature delivers various H.264 streams together with an M‑JPEG stream. These streams facilitate bandwidth-efficient viewing and recording as well as integration with third-party video management systems.

The camera can run multiple independent streams that allows to set a different resolution and frame rate on the first and second stream. The user can also choose to use a copy of the first stream.

The third stream uses the I-frames of the first stream for recording; the fourth stream shows a JPEG image at a maximum of 10 Mbit/s.

#### **Regions of interest and E-PTZ**

Regions of Interest (ROI) can be user defined. The remote E-PTZ (Electronic Pan, Tilt and Zoom) controls allow you to select specific areas of the parent image. These regions produce separate streams for remote viewing and recording. These streams, together with the main stream, allow the operator to separately monitor the most interesting part of a scene while still retaining situational awareness.

Intelligent Tracking can follow objects within the defined regions of interest. Intelligent Tracking can autonomously detect and track moving objects or the user can click on an object which the tracker will then follow.

#### **Storage management**

Recording management can be controlled by the Bosch Video Recording Manager (Video Recording Manager) or the camera can use iSCSI targets directly without any recording software.

#### **Edge recording**

Insert a memory card into the card slot to store up to 2 TB of local alarm recording. Pre-alarm recording in RAM reduces recording bandwidth on the network, and extends the effective life of the memory card.

#### **Cloud-based services**

The camera supports time-based or alarm-based JPEG posting to four different accounts. These accounts can address FTP servers or cloud-based storage facilities (for example, Dropbox). Video clips or JPEG images can also be exported to these accounts. Alarms can be set up to trigger an e-mail or SMS notification so you are always aware of abnormal events.

#### **Easy installation**

Power for the camera can be supplied via a Powerover-Ethernet compliant network cable connection. With this configuration, only a single cable connection is required to view, power, and control the camera.

Using PoE makes installation easier and more costeffective, as cameras do not require a local power source.

The camera can also be supplied with power from +12 VDC power supplies.

To increase system reliability, the camera can be simultaneously connected to both PoE and +12 VDC supplies. If one power source fails, the other source takes over without a reboot so providing power redundancy.

The automatic zoom/focus lens wizard makes it easy for an installer to accurately zoom and focus the camera for both day and night operation. The wizard is activated from the PC or from the on-board camera push button making it easy to choose the workflow that suits best.

The AVF (Automatic Varifocal) feature means that the zoom can be changed without opening the camera. The automatic motorized zoom/focus adjustment with 1:1 pixel mapping ensures the camera is always accurately focused.

#### **Automatic image rotation**

The integrated gyro/accelerometer sensor automatically corrects the image orientation in steps of 90° if the camera is mounted at right angles or upside down. The sensor image can also be rotated manually through steps of 90°.

To efficiently capture details in long hallways without loss of resolution, mount the camera at right angles. The image is displayed upright at full resolution on your monitor.

#### **Scene modes**

The camera has a very intuitive user interface that allows fast and easy configuration. Nine configurable modes are provided with the best settings for a variety of applications. Different scene modes can be selected for day or night situations.

#### **Hybrid operation**

A surge-protected analog video output allows full hybrid operation. This means that high resolution IP video streaming and an analog video output are available simultaneously. The hybrid functionality offers an easy migration path from legacy CCTV to a modern IP-based system.

#### **Aesthetic vandal resistant design**

The compact aesthetic design is suitable for installations where housing size and appearance are important. The cast-aluminum housing, polycarbonate window, and hardened inner liner can withstand the equivalent of 55 kg (120 lbs) of force (IK10). The camera is also protected against water and dust. Using the proprietary pan/tilt/rotation mechanism, installers can select the exact field of view. Mounting options are numerous, including surface, wall, corner, and suspended-ceiling mounting.

#### **True day/night switching**

The camera is a true day/night camera with a mechanical filter for vivid daytime color and exceptional night-time imaging while maintaining sharp focus under all lighting conditions. The filter can be switched remotely, or automatically via a light level sensor or contact input.

#### **Data security**

Special measures have been put in place to ensure the highest level of security for device access and data transport. The three-level password protection with security recommendations allows users to customize device access. Web browser access can be protected using HTTPS and firmware updates can also be protected with authenticated secure uploads. The on-board Trusted Platform Module (TPM) and Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) support, guarantee superior protection from malicious attacks. The 802.1x network authentication with EAP/TLS, supports TLS 1.2 with updated cipher suites including AES 256 encryption.

The advanced certificate handling offers:

- Self-signed unique certificates automatically created when required
- Client and server certificates for authentication
- Client certificates for proof of authenticity
- Certificates with encrypted private keys

#### **Complete viewing software**

There are many ways to access the camera's features: using a web browser, with the Bosch Video Management System, with the free-of-charge Bosch Video Client or Video Security Client, with the video security mobile app, or via third-party software.

#### **Video security app**

The Bosch video security mobile app has been developed to enable Anywhere access to HD surveillance images allowing you to view live images from any location. The app is designed to give you complete control of all your cameras, from panning and tilting to zoom and focus functions. It's like taking your control room with you.

This app, together with the separately available Bosch transcoder, will allow you to fully utilize our dynamic transcoding features so you can play back images even over low-bandwidth connections.

#### **System integration**

The camera conforms to the ONVIF Profile S specifications. Compliance with these standards guarantees interoperability between network video products regardless of manufacturer.
