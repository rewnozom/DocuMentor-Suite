- 4. Connect to the device wirelessly (SSID: **Teltonika_Router**) or use Ethernet cable and plug it into any LAN Ethernet port.

### **2.2 Logging in**

After you're complete with the setting up as described in the section above, you are ready to start logging into your router and start configuring it. This example shows how to connect on Windows 7. On windows Vista: click Start -> Control Panel -> Network and Sharing Centre -> Manage network Connections -> (Go to step 4). On Windows XP: Click Start -> Settings -> Network Connections -> (see step 4). You wont's see "Internet protocol version 4(TCP/IPv4)", instead you'll have to select "TCP/IP Settings" and click options -> (Go to step 6)

We first must set up our network card so that it could properly communicate with the router.

6. By default the router is going to have DHCP enabled, which means that if you select "Obtain an IP address automatically"

7. If you choose to configure manually here's what you do:

First select an IP address. Due to the stock settings that your router has arrived in you can only enter an IP in the form of 192.168.1.XXX , where XXX is a number in the range of 2-254 (192.168.1.2 , 192.168.1.254 , 192.168.1.155 and so onâ¦ are valid; 192.168.1.0 , 192.168.1.1 , 192.168.1.255 , 192.168.1.699 and so onâ¦ are not). Next we enter the subnet mask: this has to be "255.255.255.0". Then we enter the default gateway: this has to be "192.168.1.1". Finally we enter primary and secondary DNS server IPs. One will suffice, though it is good to have a secondary one as well as it will act as a backup if the first should fail. The DNS can be your routers IP (192.168.1.1), but it can also be some external DNS server (like the one Google provides: 8.8.8.8).

From here on out you can configure almost any aspect of your router.

# **3 Operation Modes**

The RUT9xx series router supports various operation modes. It can be connected to the internet (WAN) via mobile, standard Ethernet cable or via a wireless network. If you connect to the internet via an Ethernet cable of Wi-Fi, you may also backup your connection with mobile for added stability. On every case except when you connect to the internet via Wi-Fi, you can distribute your internet via an Ethernet cable (3 ports) and/or a wireless network. When you connect via Wi-Fi, you cannot have Wi-Fi in your LAN.

| WAN      | LAN      |       | Mobile Backup link |
|----------|----------|-------|--------------------|
|          | Ethernet | Wi-Fi |                    |
| Mobile   | â        | â     | x                  |
| Ethernet | â        | â     | â                  |
| Wi-Fi    | â        | x     | â                  |

In later sections it will be explained, bit by bit, how to configure your router to work in a desired mode.

# **4 Powering Options**

The RUT9xx router can be powered from power socket or over Ethernet port. Depending on your network architecture you can use LAN 1 port to power the device.

![](_page_15_Picture_6.jpeg)

RUT9xx can be powered from power socket and over Ethernet simultaneously. Power socket has higher priority meaning that the device will draw power from power socket as long as it is available.

When RUT9xx is switching from one power source to the other it loses power for a fraction of the second and may reboot. The device will function correctly after the reboot.

Though the device can be powered over Ethernet port it is not compliant with IEEE 802.3af-2003 standard. Powering RUT9xx from IEEE 802.3af-2003 power supply **will damage the device** as it is not rated for input voltages of PoE standard.

### **4.1 Powering the device from higher voltage**

If you decide not to use our standard 9 VDC wall adapters and want to power the device from higher voltage (15 â 30 VDC) please make sure that you choose power supply of high quality. Some power supplies can produce voltage peaks significantly higher than the declared output voltage, especially during connecting and disconnecting them.

While the device is designed to accept input voltage of up to 30 VDC peaks from high voltage power supplies can harm the device. If you want to use high voltage power supplies it is recommended to also use additional safety equipment to suppress voltage peaks from power supply. One of the options is to use "Teltonika" PR1000 overvoltage protection device conforming ISO 7637-2.

Warning: If an invalid PIN number was entered (i.e. the entered PIN does not match the one that was used to protect the SIM card), your SIM card will get blocked. To avoid such mishaps it is highly advised to use an unprotected SIM. If you happen to insert a protected SIM and the PIN number is incorrect, your card won't get blocked immediately, although after a couple of reboots OR configuration saves it will.

| 5. | custom DNS servers | 8.8.8.8 8.8.6.6 | Usually the gateway has some predefined DNS servers. As such the<br>router, when it needs to resolve a hostname ("www.google.com",<br>"www.cnn.com", etcâ¦) to an IP address, it will forward all the DNS<br>requests to the gateway. By entering custom DNS servers the router<br>will take care of host name resolution. You can enter multiple DNS<br>servers to provide redundancy in case the one of the server fails. |

When you select the DHCP protocol you can use it as is, because most networks will not require any additional advanced configuration.

### **6.2.2.1.3 PPPoE**

This protocol is mainly used by DSL providers:

| Common Configuration |                     |         |     |
|----------------------|---------------------|---------|-----|

### **6.2.2.2.4 IP Aliases**

IP aliases are a way of defining or reaching a subnet that works in the same space as the regular network.

| General Setup | Advanced Settings |                 |
|---------------|-------------------|-----------------|
|               | IP Address        | 192.168.99.161  |
|               | Netmask           | 255.255.255.0 â¼ |
|               | Gateway           | 192.168.99.254  |
| Delete        |                   |                 |
| Add           |                   |                 |
|               |                   | Save            |

As you can see, the configuration is very similar to the static protocol; only in the example a 99th subnet is defined. Now if some device has an IP in the 99 subnet (192.168.99.xxx) and the subnets gateway metric is "higher" and the device is trying to reach the internet it will reroute it's traffic not to the gateway that is defined in common configurations but through the one that is specified in IP aliases.

| Add           |                   |  |      |
|               |                   |  | Save |

You may also optionally define a broadcast address and a custom DNS server.

#### **6.3.2 DHCP Server**

The DHCP server is the router side service that can automatically configure the TCP/IP settings of any device that requests such a service. If you connect a device that has been configured to obtain IP address automatically the DHCP server will lease an address and the device will be able to fully communicate with the router.

| 2. | Start      | 100            | The starting address of the range that the DHCP server can use to give out to<br>devices. E.g.: if your LAN IP is 192.168.2.1 and your subnet mask is<br>255.255.255.0 that means that in your network a valid IP address has to be in<br>the range of [192.168.2.1 â 192.168.2.254](192.168.2.0 and 192.168.2.255<br>are special unavailable addresses). If the Start value is set to 100 then the<br>DHCP server will only be able to lease out addresses starting from<br>192.168.2.100 |
| 3. | Limit      | 150            | How many addresses the DHCP server gets to lease out. Continuing on the<br>above example: if the start address is 192.168.2.100 then the end address<br>will be 192.168.2.254 (100 + 150 â 1 = 254).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 4. | Lease time | 12             | How long can a leased IP be considered valid. An IP address after the<br>specified amount of time will expire and the device that leased it out will<br>have to request for a new one. Select Hour or Minute (minimum 2min).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

Here you can see the Overview of the wireless configuration. It is divided into two main sections â device and interface. One is dedicated to configuring hardware parameters other â software.

Here you can toggle the availability of the wireless radio and the physical channel frequency.

**Important note**: As seen in the picture you should always **Save** before toggling the radio on and off.

ESSID â Your wireless networks identification string. This is the name of your Wi-Fi network. When other Wi-Fi capable computers or devices scan the area for Wi-Fi networks they will see your network with this name.

Hide ESSID â Will render your SSID hidden from other devices that try to scan the area.

### **6.4.1.2 Interface**

### **6.4.1.2.1 Security**

Encryption â There are many modes of encryption, a distinctive class is pointed out below.

| Interface Configuration |                   |  |                                  |  |                   |  |
|-------------------------|-------------------|--|----------------------------------|--|-------------------|--|
| General Setup           | Wireless Security |  | MAC Filter                       |  | Advanced Settings |  |
|                         | Encryption        |  | WPA-PSK/WPA2-PSK mixed mode<br>V |  |                   |  |
|                         | Cipher            |  | Auto                             |  |                   |  |
|                         | Key               |  |                                  |  |                   |  |

First select an encryption method: TKIP, CCMP, TKIP&CCMP and auto. Note: Some authentication methods won't support TKIP (and TKIP&CCMP) encryption. After you've selected your encryption method, you should enter your passphrase, which must be at least 8 characters long.

### **6.4.1.2.2 MAC-Filter**

| Interface Configuration |                    |                   |                        |  |
|-------------------------|--------------------|-------------------|------------------------|--|
| General Setup           | Wireless Security  | MAC Filter        | Advanced Settings      |  |
|                         | MAC address filter |                   | Allow listed only<br>V |  |
|                         | MAC list           | 00:11:22:33:44:55 | +                      |  |

Filter â you can define a rule for what to do with the MAC list you've defined. You can either allow only the listed MACs or allow ALL, but forbid only the listed ones.

### **6.4.1.2.3 Advanced settings**

Separate clients â prevents Wi-Fi clients from communicating with each other on the sane subnet.

| Interface Configuration |                   |            |                   |  |  |
|-------------------------|-------------------|------------|-------------------|--|--|
| General Setup           | Wireless Security | MAC Filter | Advanced Settings |  |  |
| Separate clients        |                   |            |                   |  |  |
|                         |                   |            |                   |  |  |

#### **6.4.1.3 Client**

RUT9xx can work as a Wi-Fi client (check **6.5 Chapter** of this manual). Client mode is nearly identical to AP, except for the fact that most for the options are dictated by the wireless access point that the router is connecting to. Changing them can result in an interrupted connection to an AP.

In addition to standard options you can also click the **Scan** button to rescan the surrounding area and attempt to connect to a new wireless access point.

### **6.5 Backup WAN**

Backup WAN is function that allows you to back up your wired OR wireless connection in case they go down. At the current moment you can only backup wired and Wi-Fi

The majority of the options consist of timing and other important parameters that help determine the health of your primary connection. Regular health checks are constantly performed in the form of ICMP packets (Pings) on your primary connection. When the connections state starts to change (READY->NOT READY and vice versa) a necessary amount of failed or passed health checks has to be reached before the state changes completely. This delay is instituted so as to mitigate "spikes" in connection availability, but it also extends the time before the backup link can be brought up or down.

### **6.5.1.1 How do I set up a backup link?**

First we must pick a main link: Wired or Wi-Fi, and ensure that the link is working. Configure your WAN settings to use that link and see whether you have internet access. If the main link is working we can continue configuring our Backup Link.

Now, go to Backup WAN page and configure the settings to your liking. Click Save and wait until the settings are applied.

Now in the Status -> Network Information -> WAN page there should be a status indication for the backup WAN. If everything is working correctly you should see this:

| Backup WAN Status |  |                                              |
|-------------------|--|----------------------------------------------|
|                   |  | WAN: [Wired] IN USE   Backup WAN: [3G] READY |

The above picture shows the status for Backup WAN configured on a wired main link. You can now simulate a downed link by simply unplugging your Ethernet WAN cable. When you've done so you should see this:

| Backup WAN Status |                                                  |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
|                   | WAN: [Wired] NOT READY   Backup WAN: [3G] IN USE |
|                   |                                                  |

And, if you plug the cable back in you should, again, see this:

| Backup WAN Status |                                              |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------|
|                   | WAN: [Wired] IN USE   Backup WAN: [3G] READY |

If you do not witness the above sequence, your backup link is working!

### **6.6 Firewall**

In this section we will look over the various firewall features that come with RUT950.

#### **6.6.1 General Settings**

The routers firewall is a standard Linux iptables package, which uses routing chains and policies to facilitate control over inbound and outbound traffic.

| General Settings | Port Forwarding                                                | Traffic Rules     | Custom Rules |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|--------------|
| Firewall         |                                                                |                   |              |
|                  | General settings allows you to set up default firewall policy. |                   |              |
| General Settings |                                                                |                   |              |
|                  | Enable SYN flood protection V                                  |                   |              |
|                  | Drop invalid packets O                                         |                   |              |
|                  |                                                                | Accept -<br>Input |              |

|    | Field Name                  | Sample value       | Explanation                                                                                 |
|----|-----------------------------|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1. | Enable SYN-flood protection | Checked/Unchecked  | When checked the router becomes more resistant<br>against SYN-flood attacks.                |
| 2. | Drop Invalid packets        | Checked/Unchecked  | A "Drop" action is performed on a packet that is<br>determined to be invalid                |
| 3. | Input                       | Reject/Drop/Accept | DEFAULT* action that is to be performed for<br>packets that pass through the Input chain.   |
| 4. | Output                      | Reject/Drop/Accept | DEFAULT* action that is to be performed for<br>packets that pass through the Output chain.  |
| 5. | Forward                     | Reject/Drop/Accept | DEFAULT* action that is to be performed for<br>packets that pass through the Forward chain. |

*DEFAULT: When a packet goes through a firewall chain it is matched against all the rules for that specific chain. If no rule matches said packet, an according Action (either Drop or Reject or Accept) is performed.

Accept â Packet gets to continue down the next chain.

Drop â Packet is stopped and deleted.

Reject â Packet is stopped, deleted and, differently from Drop, an ICMP packet containing a message of rejection is sent to the **source** of the dropped packet.

**6.6.2 DMZ**

| DMZ Configuration |                     |  |
|-------------------|---------------------|--|
|                   | Enable              |  |
|                   | DMZ host IP address |  |

By enabling DMZ for a specific internal host (for e.g.: your computer), you will expose that host and its services to the routers WAN network (i.e. - internet).

#### **6.6.3 Port Forwarding**

Here you can define your own port forwarding rules.

| General Settings           |                                                                                                                   | Port Forwarding         | Traffic Rules                     | Custom Rules   |                              |               |     |      |  |        |

| 3. | External Port       | 1-65535                                    | From what port on the WAN network will the traffic be<br>forwarded.                                        |
| 4. | Internal IP address | IP address of some computer<br>on your LAN | The IP address of the internal machine that hosts some<br>service that we want to access from the outside. |
| 5. | Internal port       | 1-65535                                    | To what port on the internal machine would the rule<br>redirect the traffic.                               |

When you click **edit** you can fine tune a rule to near perfection, if you should desire that.

#### **6.6.5 Custom Rules**

Here you have the ultimate freedom in defining your rules â you can enter them straight into the iptables program. Just type them out into the text field ant it will get executed as a Linux shell script. If you are unsure of how to use iptables, check the internet out for manuals, examples and explanations.

### **6.7 Static Routes**

Static routes provide a way of entering custom entries in the internal routing table of the router.

| Static IP Routes |              |                |                |        |        |
|------------------|--------------|----------------|----------------|--------|--------|
| Interface        | Target       | Netmask        | Gateway        | Metric |        |
| lan<br>>         | 192.168.55.0 | 255.255.255.0. | 192.168.55.145 | o      | Delete |
|                  |              |                |                |        |        |

|    | Field name | Value            | Explanation                                                                                                             |
|----|------------|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1. | Interface  | LAN/WAN/PPP/WAN2 | The zone where the 'Target' resides                                                                                     |
| 2. | Target     | IP address       | The source of the traffic.                                                                                              |
| 3. | Netmask    | IP mask          | Mask that is applied to the Target to determine to what actual IP<br>addresses the routing rule applies                 |
| 4. | Gateway    | IP address       | To where the router should send all the traffic that applies to the<br>rule                                             |
| 5. | Metric     | integer          | Used as a sorting measure. If a packet about to be routed fits two<br>rules, the one with the higher metric is applied. |

Additional note on Target & Netmask: You can define a rule that applies to a single IP like this: Target - some IP; Netmask - 255.255.255.255. Furthermore you can define a rule that applies to a segment of IPs like this: Target â some IP that STARTS the segment; Netmask â Netmask that defines how large the segment is. E.g.:

| 192.168.55.161 | 255.255.255.255 | Only applies to 192.168.55.161                      |
|----------------|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| 192.168.55.0   | 255.255.255.0   | Applies to IPs in range 192.168.55.0-192.168.55.255 |
| 192.168.55.240 | 255.255.255.240 | Applies 192.168.55.240 - 192.168.55.255             |
| 192.168.55.161 | 255.255.255.0   | 192.168.55.0 - 192.168.55.255                       |
| 192.168.0.0    | 255.255.0.0     | 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255                       |

### **7.5 VPN**

### **7.5.1 OpenVPN**

*VPN (Virtual Private Network)* is a method for secure data transfer through unsafe public network. This section explains how to configure OpenVPN, which is implementation of VPN supported by the RUT950 router.

A picture below demonstrates default OpenVPN configurations list, which is empty, so you have to define a new configuration to establish any sort of OpenVPN connection. To create it, enter desired configuration name in **"New configuration name"** field, select device role from **"Role"** drop down list. For example, to create an OpenVPN client with configuration name Demo, select client role, name it "Demo" and press **"Add New"** button as shown in the following picture.

| 4. | Port           | Defines TCP or UDP port number (make sure, that this port allowed by firewall).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |  |  |
| 5. | LZO            | This setting enables LZO compression. With LZO compression, your VPN connection will<br>generate less network traffic; however, this means higher router CPU loads. Use it carefully<br>with high rate traffic or low CPU resources.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |  |  |
| 6. | Authentication | Sets authentication mode, used to secure data sessions. Two possibilities you have here:<br>"Static" means, that OpenVPN client and server will use the same secret key, which must be<br>uploaded to the router using "Static pre-shared key" option. "Tls" authentication mode uses<br>X.509 type certificates. Depending on your selected OpenVPN mode (client or server) you have<br>to upload these certificates to the router:<br>For client: Certificate Authority (CA), Client certificate, Client key.<br>For server: Certificate Authority (CA), Server certificate, Server key and Diffie-Hellman (DH)<br>certificate used to key exchange through unsafe data networks.<br>All mention certificates can be generated using OpenVPN or OpenSSL utilities on any type host<br>machine. Certificate generation and theory is out of scope of this user manual. |  |  |

| 7.  | Remote host IP<br>address     | IP address of OpenVPN server (applicable only for client configuration).                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|-----|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 8.  | Resolve Retry                 | Sets time in seconds to try resolving server hostname periodically in case of first resolve failure<br>before generating service exception.                                                                                                                                 |
| 9.  | Keep alive                    | Defines two time intervals: one is used to periodically send ICMP request to OpenVPN server,<br>and another one defines a time window, which is used to restart OpenVPN service, if no ICPM<br>request is received during the window time slice. Example Keep Alive "10 60" |
| 10. | Local tunnel<br>endpoint      | IP address of virtual local network interface (applicable only for Point to Point).                                                                                                                                                                                         |

After setting any of these parameters press **"Save"** button. Some of selected parameters will be shown in the configuration list table. You should also be aware of the fact that router will launch separate OpenVPN service for every configuration entry (if it is defined as active, of course) so the router has ability to act as server and client at the same time.

### **7.5.2 IPSec**

The IPsec protocol client enables the router to establish a secure connection to an IPsec peer via the Internet. IPsec is supported in two modes - transport and tunnel. Transport mode creates secure point to point channel between two hosts. Tunnel mode can be used to build a secure connection between two remote LANs serving as a VPN solution.

IPsec system maintains two databases: Security Policy Database (SPD) which defines whether to apply IPsec to a packet or not and specify which/how IPsec-SA is applied and Security Association Database (SAD), which contain Key of each IPsec-SA.

The establishment of the Security Association (IPsec-SA) between two peers is needed for IPsec communication. It can be done by using manual or automated configuration.

Note: router starts establishing tunnel when data from router to remote site over tunnel is sent. For automatic tunnel establishment used tunnel Keep Alive feature.

#### **7.5.3 GRE Tunnel**

GRE (Generic Routing Encapsulation RFC2784) is a solution for tunneling RFC1812 private address-space traffic over an intermediate TCP/IP network such as the Internet. GRE tunneling does not use encryption it simply encapsulates data and sends it over the WAN.

![](_page_69_Figure_2.jpeg)

In the example network diagram two distant networks LAN1 and LAN2 are connected.

To create GRE tunnel the user must know the following parameters:

- 1. Source and destination IP addresses.
- 2. Tunnel local IP address
- 3. Distant network IP address and Subnet mask

#### **7.5.6 Dynamic DNS**

Dynamic DNS (DDNS) is a domain name service allowing to link dynamic IP addresses to static hostname. To start using this feature firstly you should register to DDNS service provider (example list is given in description). You are provided with add/delete buttons to manage and use different DDNS configurations at the same time!

You can configure many different DDNS Hostnames in the main DDNS Configuration section.

Important Notes:

- 3G settings must be configured correctly. If SIM card has PIN number you must enter it at "Network" > "3G" settings. Otherwise SMS reboot function will not work.
- Sender phone number must contain country code. You can check sender phone number format by reading the details of old SMS text massages you receiving usually.

### **7.6.2 Call Utilities**

Allows users to Call the router in order to perform one of the actions: Reboot, Get Status, turn WiFi ON/OFF, turn Mobile data ON/OFF.

Only thing that is needed is to call routers SIM card number from allowed phone (user) and RUT950 will perform all actions that are assigned for this particular number.

#### **7.6.3 User Groups**

Gives possibility to group phone numbers for SMS management purposes. You can then later use these groups in all related SMS functionalities. This option helps if there are several Users who should have same roles when managing router via SMS.

#### **7.6.4 SMS Management**

You can send SMS from RUT WebUI. Under SMS Management you can read and delete received/stored SMS.

|    | Field name   | Explanation                               | Notes                                             |
|----|--------------|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| 1. | Phone number | Recipients phone number to<br>send SMS to | Should be preceded with country code, i.e. "+370" |
| 2. | Message      | SMS message text                          | All special characters are allowed.               |

With **storage** option you can choose for router NOT to delete SMS from SIM card. If this option is not used, router will automatically delete all incoming messages after they have been read. Message status "read/unread" is examined every 60 seconds. All "read" messages are deleted.

### **7.6.5 Remote Configuration**

RUT9xx can be configured via SMS from another RUT9xx. You only have to select which configuration details are to be sent, generate the SMS Text, type in the phone number and Serial number of the router that you wish to configure and Send the SMS.

**Total count of SMS is managed automatically. You should be aware of possible number of SMS and use this feature at your own responsibility. It should not, generally, be used if you have high cost per SMS. This is especially relevant if you will try to send whole OpenVPN configuration, which might acumulate ~40 SMS.** 

#### **7.6.5.1 Receive configuration**

This section controls how should configuation initiation party should identify itself. In this scenario RUT950 itself is being configured.

| 2. | Allowed users        | From all numbers<br>From group<br>From single number        | Gives greater control and security measures     |

#### **Note, that for safety reasons Authorization method should be configured before deployment of the router.**

#### **7.6.5.2 Send configuration**

This section lets you configure remote RUT950 devices. The authorization settings must confirm to those that are set on the receiving party.

### **7.7 Hotspot**

Wireless hotspot provides essential functionality for managing an open access wireless network. In addition to standard RADIUS server authentication there is also the ability to gather and upload detailed logs on what each device (denoted as a MAC address) was doing on the network (what sites were traversed, etc.).

### **7.8 Auto Reboot**

#### **7.8.1 Ping Reboot**

Ping Reboot function will periodically send Ping command to server and waits for echo receive. If no echo is received router will try again sending Ping command defined number times, after defined time interval. If no echo is received after the defined number of unsuccessful retries, router will reboot. It is possible to turn of the router rebooting after defined unsuccessful retries. Therefore this feature can be used as "Keep Alive" function, when router Pings the host unlimited number of times.

### **8.4 User scripts**

Advanced users can insert their own commands to execute at the end of the boot process.

### **8.5 Safe mode**

Router contains two firmware images in its internal flash memory. One is master firmware which is the default firmware on is constantly used by the user. Another is safe mode firmware which plays the role of the backup to the master firmware.

Safe mode firmware has most function of master firmware but to reduce its size some function were removed. Removed functions are: Wireless Hotspot, VRRPD, SNMP, Web Filter

Safe mode firmware can be recognized from different logo and reduced menu in the WebUI. The sole purpose of safe mode firmware is to allow the user to update master firmware so all configuration options are removed. To make safe mode useful it is strongly recommended to back up configuration of master firmware when the user is satisfied with the setup. After configuration backup is created it can be tested by requesting safe mode.

| Safe Mode                                                  |        |

**Keep settings** â when check box is selected router will keep saved user configuration settings after firmware upgrade. When check box is not selected all router settings will be restored to factory defaults after firmware upgrade. When upgrading firmware, you can choose settings that you wish to keep after the upgrade. This function is useful when firmware is being upgraded via Internet (remotely) and you must not lose connection to the router afterwards. In such case: **cellular settings** should be kept.

**FW image** â router firmware upgrade file.

Warning: Do not ever remove router power supply and do not press reset button during upgrade process! This will totally damage your router and it won't be accessible. If you have any problems related to firmware upgrade you should always consult with local dealer.

### **8.7 Restore point**

Allows restoring firmware and configuration from restore point.

### **8.8 Reboot**

Reboot router by pressing button "Reboot".

### **10 Device Recovery**

The following section describes available option for recovery of malfunctioning device. Usually device can become unreachable due to power failure during firmware upgrade or if core files were wrongly modified in the file system. Teltonika's router does offer several ways to recover from these situations

### **10.1 Reset button**

Reset button is located on the back panel of the device. Reset button has several functions:

**Reboot the device**. After the device has started if the reset button is pressed for up to 4 seconds the device will reboot. Start of the reboot will be indicated by flashing of all 5 signal strength LEDs together with green connection status LED.

**Reset to defaults**. After the device has started if the reset button is pressed for at least 5 seconds the device will reset all user changes to factory defaults and reboot. To help the user to determine how long should reset button be pressed signal strength LEDs count elapsed time. All 5 lit LEDs mean that 5 seconds have elapsed and reset button can be released. Start of the reset to defaults will be indicated by flashing of all 5 signal strength LEDs together with red connection status LED.

SIM PIN on the main SIM card (SIM1) is the only parameter that is kept after reset to defaults.

### **10.2 Safemode**

Router contains two firmware images in its internal flash memory. One is master firmware which is the default firmware on is constantly used by the user. Another is safemode firmware which plays the role of the backup to the master firmware.

Safemode firmware has most function of master firmware but to reduce its size some function were removed. Removed functions are:

- Wireless Hotspot
- VRRPD
- SNMP
- Web Filter

Safemode firmware can be recognized from different logo and reduced menu in the WebUI. The sole purpose of safemode firmware is to allow the user to update master firmware so all configuration options are removed. To make safemode useful it is strongly recommended to back up configuration of master firmware when the user is satisfied with the setup (described in *Safemode* section). After configuration backup is created it can be tested by requesting safemode.

### **10.3 Bootloader's WebUI**

Bootloader also provides a way to recover the router from damaged firmware. To make it easy for the user bootloader has its own webserver that can be accessed with any web browser.

Bootloader's webserver can be started:

**Automatically**. It happens when bootloader does not detect neither master nor safemode firmware. Flashing all 4 Ethernet LEDs indicate that bootloader's webserver has started.

**Manually**. Bootloader's webserver can be requested by holding reset button for 3 seconds while powering the device on. Flashing all 4 Ethernet LEDs indicate that bootloader's webserver has started.

Bootloader's WebUI can be accessed by typing this address in the web browser:

#### http://192.168.1.1/index.html

Note: it may be necessary to clear web browser's cache and to use incognito/anonymous window to access bootloader's WebUI

### **11 Glossary:**

WAN â Wide Area Network is a telecommunication network that covers a broad area (i.e., any network that links across metropolitan, regional, or national boundaries). Here we use the term WAN to mean the external network that the router uses to reach the internet.

LAN â A local area network (LAN) is a computer network that interconnects computers in a limited area such as a home, school, computer laboratory, or office building.

DHCP â The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a network configuration protocol for hosts on Internet Protocol (IP) networks. Computers that are connected to IP networks must be configured before they can communicate with other hosts. The most essential information needed is an IP address, and a default route and routing prefix. DHCP eliminates the manual task by a network administrator. It also provides a central database of devices that are connected to the network and eliminates duplicate resource assignments.

ETHERNET CABLE â Refers to the CAT5 UTP cable with an RJ-45 connector.

AP â Access point. An access point is any device that provides wireless connectivity for wireless clients. In this case, when you enable Wi-Fi on your router, your router becomes an access point.

DNS â Domain Name Resolver. A server that translates names such as www.google.lt to their respective IPs. In order for your computer or router to communicate with some external server it needs to know it's IP, its name "www.something.com" just won't do. There are special servers set in place that perform this specific task of resolving names into IPs, called Domain Name servers. If you have no DNS specified you can still browse the web, provided that you know the IP of the website you are trying to reach.

ARP â Short for Adress Resolution Protocol, a network layer protocol used to convert an IP address into a physical address (called a *DLC address*), such as an Ethernet address.

PPPoE â Point-to-Point Protocol over Ethernet. PPPoE is a specification for connecting the users on an Ethernet to the internet through a common broadband medium, such as DSL line, wireless device or cable modem.

DSL â digital subscriber line - it is a family of technologies that provide internet access by transmitting digital data using a local telephone network which uses the public switched telephone network.

NAT â network address translation â an internet standard that enables a local-area network (LAN) to use one set of IP addresses for internet traffic and a second set of addresses for external traffic.

LCP â Link Control Protocol â a protocol that is part of the PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol). The LCP checks the identity of the linked device and either accepts or rejects the peer device, determines the acceptable packet size for transmission, searches for errors in configuration and can terminate the link if the parameters are not satisfied.

BOOTP â Bootstrap Protocol â an internet protocol that enables a diskless workstation to discover its own IP address, the IP address of a BOOTP server on the network, and a file to be loaded into memory to boot the machine. This enables the workstation to boot without requiring a hard or floppy disk drive.

TCP â Transmission Control Protocol â one of the main protocols in TCP/IP networks. Whereas the IP protocol deals only with packets, TCP enables two hosts to establish a connection and exchange streams of data. TCP guarantees delivery of data and also guarantees that packets will be delivered in the same order in which they were sent.

TKIP â Temporal Key Integrity Protocol â scrambles the keys using hashing algorithm and, by adding an integritychecking feature, ensure that the keys haven't been tampered with.

CCMP â Counter Mode Cipher Block Chaining Message Authentication Code Protocol â encryption protocol designed for Wireless LAN products that implement the standards of the IEEE 802.11i amendment to the original IEEE802.11 standard. CCMP is an enchanged data cryptographic encapsulation designed for data confidentiality and based upon the Counter Mode with CBC-MAC (CCM) of the AES (Advanced Encyprion Standard) standard.

MAC â Media Access Control â hardware address that uniquely identifies each node of a network. In IEEE 802 networks, the Data Link Control (DCL) layer of the PSO Reference Model is divided into two sub-layers: the Logical Link Control (LLC) layer and the Media Access Control layer. The MAC layer interfaces directly with the network medium. Consequently, each different type of network medium requires a different MAC layer.

DMZ â Demilitarized Zone â a computer or small subnetwork that sits between a trusted internal network, such as a corporate private LAN, and an untrusted external network, such as the public internet.

UDP â User Datagram Protocol â a connectionless protocol that, like TCP, runs on top of IP networks. Provides very few error recovery services, offering instead a direct way to send and receive datagrams over IP network.

VPN â Virtual Private Network â a network that is constructed by using public wires â usually the Internet â to connect to a private network, such as a company's internal network.

VRRP â Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol - an election protocol that dynamically assigns responsibility for one or more virtual router(s) to the VRRP router(s) on a LAN, allowing several routers on a multiaccess link to utilize the same virtual IP address.

GRE Tunnel â Generic Routing Encapsulation - a tunneling protocol developed by Cisco Systems that can encapsulate a wide variety of network layer protocols inside virtual point-to-point links over an Internet Protocol internetwork.

PPPD â Point to Point Protocol Daemon â it is used to manage network connections between two nodes on Unixlike operating systems. It is configured using command-line arguments and configuration files.

SSH â Secure SHell - a program to log into another computer over a network, to execute commands in a remote machine, and to move files from one machine to another. It provides strong authentication and secure communications over insecure channels.

VRRPD â Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol â it is designed to eliminate the single point of failure associated with statically routed networks by automatically providing failover using multiple LAN paths through alternate routers.

SNMP â Simple Network Management Protocol - a set of protocols for managing complex networks. SNMP works by sending messages, called *protocol data units (PDUs)*, to different parts of a network.
