# **1 Adapter2 operation**

# **1.1 Key functions of the Adapter2**

The primary function of the *Adapter2* is forwarding reports of alarm systems to remote monitoring station over the Internet.

Main functions:

- Sends SMS, e-mail* and Push notification* with configurable message for each event
- Reports events by SMS, e-mail* and Push notification*, by voice call with voice messages uploadable as audio files, over IP to remote monitoring stations using different communication protocols and by voice call using DTMF-based Contact ID protocol.
- Reporting options:
	- SMS with configurable message up to 4 phone numbers
	- E-mail with configurable message up to 4 addresses*
	- Push notification with configurable message up to 4 users (mobile applications)*
	- Voice call up to 4 phone numbers with up to 15 uploadable messages of 10 seconds each
	- Reporting to CMS (Central monitoring station) over IP up to 4 IP addresses using SIA IP DC-09, TELLMon and TEX protocol
	- Reporting to CMS by voice call using DTMF-based (DC-05) Contact ID protocol
- Up to 10 notification templates can be created and assigned to events in order to configure the priorities of reporting channels used for reporting to CMS
- Configurable Contact ID event codes for each input and service event, including partition and zone options
- Output control can be customized separately for each event using different operation modes, which can also be used to arm or disarm the connected alarm control panel remotely, through the mobile application.
- Available custom events: input events, service and error events (new and restore as well)
- IP camera support: forwards the links of up to 4 IP cameras by e-mail and Push notification along with the alarm messages

* available in the **PRO** model only

** SMS and call based functions are not available in the **WiFi** product model.

# **1.2 Differences between the** *Adapter2* **and the** *Adapter2 PRO* **models**

There are differences in function between the **Adapter2** and the **Adapter2 PRO** product models. The **Adapter2 PRO** includes the following extra functions:

- E-mail notification
- Push notification
- **TELL Control Center** multiplatform mobile application (iOS and Android)
- IP camera support

# **1.3 Differences between the 2G, 3G, 3GA, 4G, 4GA and WiFi models**

The only difference between the **2G**, **3G** and **4G** models is the type of the modem used. The 3G (UMTS) and the 4G (LTE) communication makes possible higher speed, thereby increasing the speed of reporting. The **2G**, **3G** and the **4G** models can be used in Europe, while the **3GA** model is equipped with a pentaband UMTS/HSPA modem that can be used worldwide. The **4GA** model is equipped with a multiband LTE modem which can be used in North America. There is no difference between the mentioned models with regard to the available functions or configuration. For the **2G** model, calls made through the GSM network will delay all other communication, since 2G modems are unable to use multiple communication channels simultaneously.

The **WiFi** model can only be used with a WiFi network. SMS and call-based functions are not available in this model, since it does not have a GSM modem. In turn, this model does not require a SIM card.

# **2 Connecting the terminals and putting into operation**

**Attention! Do NOT connect the metallic parts of the GSM antenna connector or the terminals of the device directly or indirectly to the protective ground, because this may damage the device!**

# **2.1 Under Voltage Lock Out (UVLO) function**

![](_page_4_Picture_6.jpeg)

The **Adapter2** is provided with built-in automatic power disconnection (Under Voltage Lock Out) function. The device will turn off automatically when the supply voltage drops below critical level, and turns back on when the voltage restores to operational level.

# **2.2 Connections and wiring**

![](_page_4_Figure_9.jpeg)

System terminal inputs and outputs:

- **V+** Supply voltage 12…24V DC (min. 500mA)
- **V-** Supply voltage negative
- **LINE** Simulated phone line output (connect to alarm system phone line input terminals)
- **IN1** Dry contact input 1
- **IN2** Dry contact input 2
- **IN3** Dry contact input 3
- **IN4** Dry contact input 4
- **COM** Common negative for the contact inputs and the output (potential equivalent with **V-**)
- **OUT** Relay output (switches the negative, max. 1A)

# **Attention!**

**Although the** *COM* **and** *V-* **terminals are equivalent, due to the design of internal circuit protections, the** *COM* **terminal shall not be used as negative input for powering the device, because this may damage the device! The** *COM* **terminal should only be used for connecting the contact inputs and the relay output!**

**We would not advise powering the device directly from the power output of the alarm control panel (AUX), as we can't guarantee that the given output is able to fully operate the device. Insufficient powering may lead to communication errors and frequent device restarting, making it impossible for the device to operate normally as expected. To avoid this, we suggest that you use a separate power supply for the device.**

# **2.3 Input wiring**

For the inputs, the normally closed or normally open dry contact should be connected between the given input (**IN1**…**IN4**) and the negative of the power input (**V-**) or the **COM** terminal.

If a normally open dry contact is used to activate the input, choose the **NO** (normally open) option in the given input's settings. In this case, the input will become activated when the open contact between the given input (**IN1**…**IN4**) and the **V-** terminal (or the **COM** terminal) becomes closed.

If a normally closed dry contact is used to activate the input, choose the **NC** (normally closed) option in the given input's settings. In this case, the input will become activated when the closed contact between the given input (**IN1**…**IN4**) and the **V-** terminal (or the **COM** terminal) becomes open.

# **2.4 Output wiring**

The output provides normally open (N.O.) dry (potential free) relay contact by default and closed contact upon control.

# **2.5 SIM card holder**

The SIM card holder can be accessed by removing the cover of the aperture found on the device enclosure.

**Note:** the **WiFi** device model does not require a SIM card, therefore it has no SIM card holder. The cover can be removed by pressing it with your fingernail towards the LED at the end where the gap is and then pulling it outwards. Insert the SIM card in the holder. The services to be activated on the SIM card installed into the **Adapter2** device should be chosen according to which services of the device you wish to use. Basically, for communication with receivers and servers it requires a SIM card with mobile Internet access that may use either public or private APN. The functions that use SMS sending need SMS service and the ones that use calls require GSM voice call service.

- Installing the SIM card:
![](_page_6_Figure_1.jpeg)

- **1.** Pull the metal security lock of the SIM holder towards the LED until you hear a click.
- **2.** Reach under the metallic security lock with your fingernail and pull to open the holder.
- **3.** Slide the SIM card into the opened part with the contacts facing down, as shown in the figure.
- Fold back the opened part together with the SIM card.
- Secure the SIM card by pressing down carefully the metallic security lock and pulling it towards the side of the enclosure until you hear a click.

# **2.6 Connecting the antenna**

Connect the GSM antenna to the FME-M socket. The device comes with an antenna that provides good transmission under normal reception circumstances. In case of experiencing signal strength problems or/and wave interference (fading), use a directed antenna, or find a more advantageous mounting place for the antenna. In case of installing the unit into a metal box, the antenna should be mounted outside the box, in a place where the measured GSM signal is the highest available.

# **2.7 Installation**

# **Please check the environment before installing:**

- Verify the GSM signal with your mobile phone. It may happen that the signal strength is not sufficient in the place where you planned to mount the device. If this is the case, you can reconsider the place of installation before mounting the device.
- Do not mount the unit in places where it may be affected by strong electromagnetic disturbances (e.g. close to electric motors, high voltage, etc.).
- Do not mount the unit in wet places, or places with a high degree of humidity.

# **2.8 Putting into operation**

- *Disable the voicemail service and SMS notification about missed calls on the SIM card installed in the device.*
- *The device can handle the SIM card's PIN code. If you want to use the PIN code management, configure the SIM card's PIN code in the programming software in the "General" device settings menu. Otherwise disable PIN code request on the SIM card.*
- *Enable caller identification service on the SIM card at the GSM service provider* (this service might not be enabled by default, please check). To enable this service, install the SIM card into a mobile phone and call the customer service of the card's GSM service provider and enable the service in the menu, or visit one of the service provider's personal customer services and ask to enable this service on the SIM card.
- Check the SIM card to be installed correctly into the device.
- Check the GSM antenna to be connected correctly to the device.
- Check the wires to be connected as instructed in the wiring diagram.
- You can power up the device (12-24V DC). Make sure that the power source is sufficient for the operation of the **Adapter2** device.

# **3 General information about the operation of the device**

#### **3.1 Remote monitoring application overview**

![](_page_8_Figure_2.jpeg)

The **Adapter2** models equipped with a modem communicate with the TELLMon or SIA DC-09 receivers and TEX-MVP servers through the GSM service provider's APN gateway using the GPRS/UMTS/LTE network, and then through the Internet. After processing and conversion, the server forwards the received data packages through serial port towards the monitoring PC that runs the alarm monitoring software. Alternative reporting channels: GSM voice call and SMS.

The WiFi product model connects to the Internet via a local WiFi router and does not support alternative reporting via voice call or SMS.

#### **3.1.1 General information about the notification process**

The device sends notifications based on own events available in the device, and based on the configuration of the connected alarm system's events.

There are 4 event categories available in the device: input events, service events, custom events, and alarm system events.

- **Input events**: Input events are generated by triggering the contact inputs on the device.
- **Service events**: Service events are generated automatically by the device, such as error events, own periodic test report, or events on reaching different configured limits.
- **Custom events**: Custom events are generated by freely configurable commands sent to the device in a text message. Custom events and commands can be configured optionally in the device.
- **Alarm system events**: Alarm system events are Contact ID messages received from the connected alarm system via the device's simulated phone line input.

When an event is generated, the device starts the notifications and controls configured for that event. The order of notifications corresponds to the order in which the events occurred.

#### **Reporting to a remote monitoring station**

You can assign one from the notification templates configured in advance to each event. In a notification template you can configure, which of the configured monitoring receivers should be notified, and with what priority. Backup reporting by SMS can also be set for the case when reporting fails to all of the selected receivers. Reporting a given event will thereby be performed according to the notification template associated with it. With regard to events received from the connected alarm system, it is possible to filter events by event code, partition, and zone number. Thereby, you can add a filter for a group of events or even a specific event, of which reporting can be configured likewise, by assigning a notification template customized as needed. Furthermore, depending on the device settings, as a backup option, the alarm system can also send reports via DTMF based voice call to a landline receiver, by dialing a specific phone number.

# **Notification sending to users**

Regardless of reporting to remote monitoring station, you can configure notifications for users by call, SMS, Push message or e-mail (depending on the product model).

Reporting to remote monitoring station has priority against notification of users. The device sends the events simultaneously to the configured IP addresses. It sends the ACK signal towards the alarm control panel only when it receives the ACK from at least one of the configured receivers (IP addresses). Regardless to this, event sending continues towards the other receivers. If the device does not receive an ACK signal from any of the configured receivers, it tries to report the event for up to 10 minutes. If reporting to the configured IP addresses fails for the mentioned 10 minutes, the device stops reporting the event and will no longer send notification on the given event, but the event will be shown in the event logs.

# **4 Configuring the Adapter2**

The **Adapter2** can be configured the following ways:

- By computer via USB, using the programming software.
- By computer over the Internet, using the programming software.

The **Adapter2** programming software is compatible with the following operating systems:

# **Windows 10 (32/64 bit)**

Earlier Windows operating systems are not supported by the software.

**Installing the programming software**: open the software setup application and follow the instructions of the installation wizard to complete the installation. The latest version of the programming software is available on the manufacturer's website [(http://www.tell.hu)](http://www.tell.hu/en).

The **Adapter2** programming software can be used to configure all **Adapter2** device models.

# **4.1 The user interface and configuration options of the software**

The user interface language can be selected during installation.

The user interface appearance can be changed using the "*Skin*" dropdown-menu found in the "*Software settings*" / "*Settings*" menu, where you can choose from various appearance themes.

The software saves changes related to appearance upon closing and applies the saved settings when reopened.

# **4.2 Methods for connecting to the device**

![](_page_10_Figure_14.jpeg)

For connecting to the device using the programming software, the following options are available:

**USB**: direct connection using a USB A-B cable.

**TEX-MVP**: remote connection through the Internet via the TEX-MVP server. This option can be used by central monitoring stations that own a TEX-MVP server.

**TELLMon**: remote connection through the Internet via the TELLMon receiver. This option can be used by central monitoring stations that own a TELLMon receiver.

**Cloud**: remote connection through the Internet via the cloud server operated by the manufacturer.

**Peer-to-peer**: direct remote connection via the Internet. This option can be used if the computer running the programming software, and the SIM card installed in the **Adapter2** device are in the same VPN or a private APN.

connected via USB (grey)

- After connecting using the valid password, you can configure the device, change settings, download event logs and monitor system status.
- To close the connection, click on "*Disconnect*" button.

#### **4.2.2 Remote connecting to devices via cloud service**

**This connection type can be used if the** *Adapter2* **device is connected to the cloud. For this, the APN settings should be configured in the "***General***" settings menu, and a SIM card with available mobile Internet service should be installed in the device, which may use either a public or a private APN, but in the latter case, you have to arrange with the mobile service provider to open the given private APN for accessing the cloud server IP address at 54.75.242.103, port: 2020.**

If the "*Cloud usage*" option is enabled in the "*General*" settings menu, the device will be continuously online, so it can be accessed anytime over the cloud. If you don't want to enable permanent cloud usage due to the data use that it involves, it is possible to command the device by SMS to connect temporarily to the cloud, about which you can read more in the below.

With this connection type, connection between the device and the **Adapter2** programming software will be established through the cloud server operated by the manufacturer.

The "*System logs*" option of the programming software cannot be used in case of remote connection over the Internet.

| Connection password    | Remote device availabilities |                                |
|------------------------|------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Admin password<br>文字字字 | Device name                  | Device ID<br>21:45:44:42:01:01 |

**Admin password**: the security password of the device (default superadmin password: **1234**).

**Device ID**: the device identifier of the **Adapter2** device to which you wish to connect. The format of this unique, burned-in during production and thereby unchangeable device identifier used for cloud connection is: **FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF** (6x2 hexadecimal characters).

You can read the device ID of the given device in the "*Device ID*" section of the "*Status monitoring*" menu, when connected to the device. The device will also send its device ID in a reply to your request for connecting to the cloud, sent by SMS to the device, about which you can read more below.

Connecting to the device through the cloud:

- Enter the connection password.
	- o Super administrator permission: full access to all settings. (Default password: **1234**).
	- o Administrator permission: full access to all settings except device identification settings.
	- o Connecting remotely without a password is not possible.
- Select the "*Cloud*" option in the "*Connection type*" menu.
- If you have registered the device in the "*Device register*" menu, select the device you want to access from the "*Device Name*" drop-down menu, or enter the device ID of the device in the "*Device ID*" field.

- If cloud usage is enabled in the settings of the given device, the device keeps continuous connection with the cloud server. In this case skip the SMS sending process mentioned below. Cloud usage can be enabled in the "*General*" settings menu. If cloud usage is disabled, the device will not keep continuous connection with the cloud, it will only connect upon request. Therefore, if this is the case, before trying to connect remotely to the device, the request for connecting to the server should be sent by SMS to the phone number of the SIM card installed into the device. The device accepts the request for connecting to the cloud server from any phone number if the valid device password is specified in the message. For this, the device password should be added in the message using the "**PWD**" parameter, as specified below. Commands sent with a missing device password or a wrong password, will be ignored by the device and it will not send any reply to these numbers.
The request command for connecting to the server is: **CONNECT,PWD=***device password***#**

**PWD:** the device password can be specified using this parameter. The superadmin and admin passwords are both accepted (default superadmin password: 1234).

Example on the usage of the command mentioned above: **CONNECT,PWD=1234#**

Send the mentioned request command for connecting to the cloud by SMS to the phone number of the SIM card installed in the device, and wait for the device's reply. As soon as the device successfully connects to the cloud, it will send the following reply:

#### **Connected to** (*IP address***:***port number*) **ID=**(*device identifier*)

If cloud usage is disabled in the device settings, the device remains connected to the cloud for 10 minutes only and thereafter in case of inactivity it disconnects automatically. Therefore, you have 10 minutes to connect to the device after it sends the reply message.

If you receive no message from the device within 1 or 2 minutes, please make sure that the settings are correct and that the circumstances of sending the request for connecting satisfy the conditions mentioned above.

Possible error messages:

| Missing APN              | The APN is not configured.                                                                                        |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Network connection error | The device is unable to connect to the Internet due to an<br>error, faulty settings, or missing Internet service. |

If the APN settings are not configured in the device, or if they are wrong, you can configure this using the following SMS commands. It is also possible to configure the cloud settings, but normally the factory default values are configured for this.

| SMS command                                          | Specification                                                                                      |

# **5.1.1 Viewing the settings options and configuring offline**

The **Adapter2** programming software supports all **Adapter2** device models, therefore the software shows the settings options available specifically in a given device model, which are different from the common parameters (e.g. differences between the **PRO** and non **PRO** device models) only when connecting the given device model, i.e. an **Adapter2** device has to be connected in order to show the specific settings options of that device model.

However, using the "*Offline device selector*" it is possible to view the settings options of any **Adapter2** device model and to configure and save the settings in advance offline, without connecting the device.

If you wish to view the settings options of a **Adapter2** device model, or to configure and save settings without connecting the device, click on the arrow found next to the

"*Offline device selector*" button, select the desired device model from the drop-down menu

and then click on the "*Offline device selector*" button to load the settings options of the selected device model.

In the "*Connection type*" menu you can select the method for connecting to the device (USB or different options for connecting over the Internet), view information about the connection process, change the admin and superadmin passwords, restart the device, and restore the factory default settings in the device.

The default superadmin password is **1234**. If you want to use the admin level access as well, for this the password should be configured separately by clicking on the "*Change Admin password*" button (for "*Actual password*" enter the superadmin password).

Available options:

- **Change Admin password**:
	- You can change the administrator level password after clicking on this button.

- **Change Superadmin password**:
	- You can change the superadministrator level password after clicking on this button.

Enter the actual password, then the new password and its confirmation, then click "*OK*". The password should consist of at least 4, but not more than 8 characters. Accepted characters are: numbers (0...9), lower case letters (a...z), and capital letters (A...Z).

Attention! The following characters should not be used: ^ ~ < > = | \$ % " '.

**Details**: in this window you can follow the connection progress.

- Restart the device:
If necessary, you can restart the connected device by clicking on this button.

- Restore factory default settings:
By clicking on this button, you can restore the factory default settings in the device. Restoring the factory default settings will erase the actual settings, therefore please save your settings if needed. The reset process may take more than 1 minute and involves a device restart. Wait until the device restarts and the LED indicator starts working again. The option of restoring the factory default settings is also available without entering the device password. The factory default settings cannot be restored if the device has been locked in the settings. If you have forgotten the device passwords and the device is locked, only the manufacturer can restore the factory default settings in the service center.

The device register serves for storing and easy handling of device availabilities used for remote programming. You can add new device availabilities to the database and also edit, delete and clone entries for easy adding of devices with similar availabilities.

When connecting remotely, you can easily select by name the device you wish to connect to from the "*Device name*" drop-down menu, from the devices added to the database. In the drop-down menu the program indicates which types of connection have been configured for the given device, which helps you select the appropriate connection type.

| Device name    | TEX-MVP | TELLMon | Cloud | Peer-to-peer |
|----------------|---------|---------|-------|--------------|
| Adapter 2 Demo |         |         |       |              |

If you add a new device availability in the connection type section, the program will add it automatically to the device register database by using the device ID as device name, which you can then change by editing the given entry. The database is stored locally on the computer.

Function buttons available in the "*Device register*" menu:

Data stored by the device register:

**Device name**: custom name

**SIM identifier (ICCID)**: the identifier of the SIM card installed in the device (if the SIM card is installed, the software reads the ID automatically from the device and inserts the data in this field when you create a new device availability entry). If automated reading fails, you can enter the ID manually or copy it from the "*Status monitoring*" menu.

**Device phone number**: in this field you can enter the phone number of the SIM card installed in the device. It has no specific function, it's purpose is informational.

**Comment**: in this field you can enter custom comments related to the given device.

**Connection type**: you can configure multiple remote availabilities for the same device (TEX-MVP, TELLMon, cloud, peer-to-peer), according to what type of server or receiver the device connects to. The availabilities belonging to given types of connection can be configured under the tabs labeled with the name of the connection type.

![](_page_21_Picture_8.jpeg)

A green icon will be shown on the tabs of connection types for which device availabilities have already been provided, and a red icon will be shown on the tabs where availabilities have not been configured or the data are deficient. To make it easier for you, the program will automatically fill in the data fields for connection types for which the availabilities are available (e.g. if the device is connected via USB, the program knows the availability of the cloud server, and the necessary device identifier will be read automatically from the device via USB).

**Server/receiver address**: the IP address or domain name of the server/receiver.

**Port**: the communication port number of the server/receiver.

**Server password**: (for the TEX-MVP protocol only) the 20 hexadecimal-character server password (5x4 characters separated by hyphen).

**Device ID**: the device identifier. The format of the device identifier is:

- **-** for cloud usage and the TELLMon protocol: **FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF** (6x2 hexadecimal characters, unique, burned-in during production and thereby unchangeable device identifier). The device ID (used for cloud connection and the TELLMon protocol) of the connected device is shown in the "*Status monitoring*" menu / "*Device ID*" field.
- **-** for the TEX-MVP protocol: **FFF** (3 hexadecimal characters).

**Device IP address**: the IP address of the SIM card installed in the device. If the SIM card is installed, and obtaining an IP address from the mobile network was successful, and the device is connected via USB, the software reads the IP address automatically from the device and inserts the data in these fields, when you create a new device availability entry. Otherwise, you can also enter the IP address manually. A static IP address is needed, used in a private APN.

# **Adding a device register database from file**

You can add a previously saved device register database from file. When adding, entries stored in the program will not be deleted. The program will add the content of the loaded file to existing entries.

In order to add a database, click on the "*Add from file*" button, browse the database file, and then click on the "*Add*" button in the newly opened progress window.

By this, the program will read and add the entries from the selected file and will prepare an import summary. During the adding process, the content of the loaded file will be compared with the entries stored in the program. The program verifies the names of the entries, and it will not add entries saved with the same name, regardless of the data contained. The program will indicate, if there are issues in the file to be imported, e.g. entry names which already exist in the database stored in the program, or other entries that the program cannot process.

The program classifies the entries into 3 categories, which you can read in the "*Type*" column, and marks each with a different background color for better transparency:

- **- Information** (green background color): entries imported successfully.
- **- Warning** (yellow background color): entries processed successfully, but the entry name already exists in the database stored in the program.
- **- Error** (red background color): entries with errors, which the program cannot process.

#### **The program will not import entries marked as "***Warning***" or "***Error***"!**

At the bottom of the list, you can find a summary line with the number of entries imported successfully, the ones marked as warnings, and the ones with errors. You can close the progress window by clicking on the "*Close*" button.

#### **5.2 Device settings menu**

You can configure the device settings in the submenus available in the "*Device settings*" menu.

- **Changing the device settings**: In order to change the device settings, first you have to read
the actual settings from the device by clicking the "*Read*" button in a submenu in either "*Device settings*" or "*Alarm system events*" menu. Writing the new settings into the device using the "*Write*" button is not possible until the settings are read. After making changes

in the settings, write the settings into the device by clicking on the "*Write*" button.

- **Overwriting the device settings**: If you want to completely overwrite the settings, you can import and write data from a from a previously made system backup. To create a system backup file, configure the desired settings in the submenus, and then click on the
	- "*Save to file*" button in the "*General*" device settings menu. You can import the saved

backup into the program using the "*Load from file*" button, and then write imported

settings into the device by clicking on the "*Write*" button. This is useful when you want to configure many devices with the same settings.

# **a change is made. For this, click on the "***Write***" button.**

## **SIM:**

**PIN code**: if you want to use PIN code management, enter in this section the PIN code of the SIM card installed in the device. Otherwise, disable PIN code request on the SIM card. If the wrong PIN code has been entered, the device will try the code only once each time the code is changed in the settings and PIN code error message will be shown in the system logs. If the wrong code is configured 3 times consecutively, the SIM card will reach the PUK code request stage. In this case, install the SIM card into a cellphone, unlock the card by entering the PUK code when requested, and configure the valid PIN code in the device settings.

**APN**: the access point name necessary to connect to the Internet. Ask this from the mobile service provider of the SIM card installed in the device. If no APN is configured, the device will not try to connect to the Internet. In this case you can only use the functions which do not require Internet connection, such as voice calls and SMS sending.

**APN user name**: a user name is necessary only if the mobile service provider provides this and requires its usage for the given APN.

**APN password**: a password is necessary only if the mobile service provider provides this and requires its usage for the given APN.

**Device phone number**: in this field you can enter the phone number of the SIM card installed in the device. It has no specific function, it's purpose is informational.

**SIM card lock**: if you enable this option, the device will remember the ID of the SIM card installed, and will refuse to operate with any other SIM card until the option is disabled.

**Cloud usage**: if this option is enabled, the device will connect to the cloud server operated by the manufacturer and will stay connected permanently. In order to ensure a continuous connection and availability, the device sends supervision messages that use about **12 MB data per month** on its own. Using the cloud server, special services become available, such as remote programming and remote monitoring of your device over the cloud. If this option is enabled, the device will always be online and thereby accessible anytime. If this option is disabled, you can still initiate a temporary cloud connection manually, by sending a command via SMS to the phone number of the device. You can read more about this in the "*[Remote connecting to devices via](#page--1-0)  [cloud service](#page--1-0)*" paragraph. In case of using a SIM card that uses a private APN, the given private APN should be opened at the mobile service provider to access the cloud server IP address at 54.75.242.103, port: 2020.

#### **Identification:**

**User account ID**: the user account ID necessary for Contact ID reporting to CMS. The events and, if using the TELLMon or TEX protocol, the supervision messages too, are sent to the configured servers or receivers using the user account ID configured in this section. The user account ID length is 4 hexadecimal characters and the following characters can be used: 0..9, A, B, C, D, E, F.

**Alarm system user account ID replacement**: if you enter a user account identifier in this field, the device will replace the user account ID in the Contact ID messages received from the connected alarm system, configured in the alarm control panel, with the identifier number entered here, and will send the messages to the remote monitoring station with this user account ID. This option comes handy when you want to change the user account ID in the alarm control panel, but you have no access to its settings.

**Group ID**: the CMS identifier in hexadecimal format. This is only required if the TEX protocol is used for reporting to CMS. If you do not possess this identifier, please contact your reseller.

**Device ID**: the device identifier in hexadecimal format. This is only required if the TEX protocol is used for reporting to CMS. The length is 3 characters and the following characters can be used: 0…9, A, B, C, D, E, F.

**SIA user account ID**: in case of using the SIA IP protocol, the supervision messages are sent to CMS using the user account ID configured in this section. The length of the SIA user account ID is 1 to 6 hexadecimal characters, and the following characters can be used: 0..9, A, B, C, D, E, F. Do not fill in the account ID section with zeros!

**Note!** The user account ID, group ID, device ID and SIA user account ID are only needed if reporting to CMS is used.

# **Serial port:**

In this section you can configure the transparent serial port settings. The serial port on the device enables transparent data communication between the device and the *Remote Serial Client*  software developed for this purpose. The purpose of the serial port is to enable remote programming of the alarm control panel connected to the device, over the Internet. Configure the settings according to the requirements of the device (alarm control panel or other device) connected to the serial port of the *Adapter2*.

Available options: baud rate, parity and stop bits.

You can find further help on how to configure the serial port for use with the most popular alarm systems, in paragraph "*[Remote programming of alarm control panels](#page--1-25)*".

#### **System time**:

**NTP server 1,2**: in this section you can select one of the default NTP servers or you can also configure custom NTP servers which you wish to use for system time synchronization. The device synchronizes the system time from the GSM network and if this fails, it will use the NTP servers. If synchronization from the NTP servers also fails, it will synchronize the date and time using the timestamp received from a CMS server/receiver, if CMS is used.

**Time zone**: select the time zone according to the location of installation. The device adjusts the system time according to the time zone setting. If the setting is wrong, there will be difference between the system time and the local time and therefore the timestamps of the events will also be wrong and the periodic test report will also be sent at the wrong time of day.

#### **Operating mode used upon dialing a number via the simulated phone line:**

#### **Operating mode**:

- **Start a GSM voice call upon any dialed phone number:** the device will not send the handshake signal, but will initiate a GSM voice call to the dialed phone number and will make possible DTMF communication or speech through the simulated phone line.
- **Receive and process alarm system messages upon dialing the specified numbers; for other phone numbers start a GSM voice call:** you can configure up to 4 phone numbers and if the alarm control panel dials one of these through the simulated phone line, the device will send the handshake signal and will receive the reports of the alarm control panel, respectively will send these over IP according to the settings. If the alarm control panel dials a different phone number which is not configured in this section, the device will initiate a GSM voice call to the dialed phone number and will make possible DTMF communication or speech through the simulated phone line. This function offers the possibility for backup reporting to DTMF receivers. For this, the alarm control panel should be configured such way, that if reporting to the phone numbers (max. 4) specified in this section fails, the alarm control panel should call a different phone number (the DTMF receiver's number) to which the device will already initiate a GSM voice call.
- **Receive and process alarm system messages upon any number dialed:** no matter what number the alarm control panel dials through the simulated phone line, the device will automatically send the handshake signal and will receive the reports of the alarm control panel, respectively will send these over IP according to the settings. This option can be used for easy alignment if you wish to send reports only over IP, but you do not know what number the alarm control panel dials or cannot change that.

If you connect an alarm control panel to the simulated line, no matter which operating mode you choose, the device will process alarm system messages received or passed through by call. Thereby, it is possible to send further notifications (voice call, SMS, Push, e-mail) about these messages, according to the alarm system event settings. The difference between the operating modes is just that the device will or will not pass through the call to the GSM network, depending on the number dialed by the alarm control panel.

Configure the connected alarm control panel to wait for the dial tone before dialing!

**Attention!** Please note that in certain cases you may experience issues with reporting to CMS over DTMF-based voice call. Success of communication highly depends on the properties of the given GSM network, such as line quality, line noise and DTMF handling. Due to network digitalization, DTMF signal tones might get distorted while being processed by the network in such extent that the receiver will not be able to interpret the transmitted Contact ID event codes. The risk of this is even higher if the signal is transmitted through multiple GSM operators (e.g. if using SIM cards from different operators on the transmission and reception site). The device offers an option to adjust the signals in order to correct such problems, therefore if necessary, special DTMF communication parameters can be configured in the "*Advanced settings*" menu.

#### **Auto dialing – emergency call function:**

**Automatically dialed phone number:** this function can be used for some special applications (e.g. automatic emergency call). If configured so, the device will dial the given number automatically through the GSM network after the delay configure in the "*Dialing delay*" section, upon picking up the receiver of the landline phone device connected to the *Adapter2*. When the automatic dialing function is used, the device can also be used with an alarm control panel, if an appropriate dialing delay is configured.

Due to security reasons, the auto dialing feature is not available if "*Receive and process alarm system messages upon any number dialed*" option is selected under "*Operating mode*".

**Dialing delay:** the device will dial the phone number configured in the "*Automatically dialed phone number*" section after the delay configured here, when it detects off-hook on the simulated line output. If you wish to use the auto dialing function when the device is being used with an alarm control panel, configure the dialing delay so that the alarm control panel should have enough time to start dialing the number it has to call, still before the device starts dialing the number to be called automatically. The device will not make a call to the number to be dialed automatically if it detects dialing on the simulated line during the configured dialing delay. In this case it will manage the communication received through the simulated line.

#### **Miscellaneous settings:**

**Incoming call from unknown phone number:** in this section you can configure what the device should do when it receives a call from a phone number which is not configured in the device as a user phone number, or a call from private number (with hidden caller ID).

Available options:

- **Forward calls to the simulated line**: the device will forward these calls to the simulated phone line output (**LINE**). If a landline phone device is connected to the line output, the phone will ring and speech communication is possible after accepting the call. Regardless of this setting, when a call is received from an unknown phone number, a related service event is generated for which you can configure output control or notification sending.
- **Reject calls**: the device will reject calls received from the given phone number.

**SMS forwarding daily limit:** with this setting you can limit the number of SMS messages to be forwarded per day. When the configured limit is reached, the device will not forward new incoming SMS messages for 24 hours. After 24 hours the message counter resets automatically, and incoming messages will be forwarded again up to the configured limit. When the limit is reached, a service event will be generated, which you can configure separately to control the output(s) or send notifications. The SMS forwarding daily limit can be disabled and set to unlimited by deleting the entered value.

**Attention!** After reaching the configured limit, but before the message counter resets, the device deletes all incoming messages without forwarding!

**SMS sending daily limit:** with this setting you can limit sending of SMS messages generated by events. When the configured limit is reached, the device will not send further event-generated SMS messages for 24 hours. After 24 hours the message counter resets automatically, and SMS message sending will be enabled again up to the configured limit. When the limit is reached, a service event will be generated, which you can configure separately to control the output(s) or send notifications. The SMS sending daily limit can be disabled and set to unlimited by deleting the entered value.

**Daily limit for calls**: with this setting you can limit the number of voice calls generated by events. When the configured limit is reached, the device will not make further event-generated calls for 24 hours. After 24 hours the call counter resets automatically, and voice calls will be enabled again up to the configured limit. When the limit is reached, a service event will be generated, which you can configure separately to control the output(s) or send notifications. The daily limit for calls can be disabled and set to unlimited by deleting the entered value.

**SMS forwarding phone number:** the device forwards the messages received by its SIM card to the phone number configured in this section (e.g. balance information received from the GSM service provider in case of pre-pay card). The received messages are deleted automatically after forwarding. If no phone number is configured, the device deletes all incoming messages without forwarding.

**Forward SMS messages received from users**: if this option is enabled, the device will also forward SMS messages received from user phone numbers configured in the "*Reporting channels*" menu (e.g. commands sent to the device via SMS), to the phone number entered in the "*SMS forwarding phone number*" field. If this option is disabled, the device will only forward messages received from other phone numbers, but not messages received from users.

# **Device manager:**

In case of assigning a mobile application to the *Adapter2* device, receiving alerts from the device will become available through Push notification too. For this, when configuring events, you can select which of the up to 4 (**PUSH1…PUSH4**) assigned mobile devices you wish to receive a Push notification on when the given event occurs.

**Name**: the name of mobile device's user. The name entered in this section will be used to identify the mobile devices when selecting the notification channels upon configuring events.

**Registration password**: the registration password has to be provided in the mobile application when you wish to assign it to the device. This password can be configured in this section separately for each mobile device you wish to register. The registration password length is 4 to 8 characters and only letters and numbers are accepted. Accented letters are not accepted.

**Mobile device**: in this field the name of an already registered mobile device is shown, which is read by the mobile application from the mobile device itself, therefore this name cannot be changed in the programming software.

**APP ID**: in this field the identifier of an already registered mobile device is shown. This identifier is used to identify the mobile device and it is unique for each device.

**Delete**: the "*Delete*" button is used to delete the given mobile device, i.e. to cancel its registration. In case of deleting a mobile device, the application used on the given device will no longer have access to the *Adapter2* device.

In the "*Reporting channels*" menu you can configure the availabilities where notifications should be sent, such as monitoring servers or receivers, user phone numbers for calls and SMS sending, and e-mail addresses for notification by e-mail in case of using the *Adapter2 PRO* model.

Available options:

- Reading the settings from the device:
To read the settings from the device, click on the "*Read*" button. This will read all settings in all menus.

- Writing the settings into the device:
![](_page_33_Picture_7.jpeg)

After changing the settings or entering new settings, in order to take effect, it is necessary to write the new settings into the device by clicking on the "*Write*" button. This will write the changes only, but all changes made in any menu.

- Data usage calculator:
![](_page_33_Picture_10.jpeg)

The data usage calculator shows an estimated monthly data usage based on the configured settings and the expected number of reports and messages. For this, you need to provide the expected number of reports and messages only.

**Please note that the settings have to be written in the device in order to be applied after**

**a change is made. For this, click on the "***Write***" button.**

# **CID reporting to CMS over IP:**

You can configure up to 4 IP availabilities of CMS servers or receivers as follows.

**Name**: CMS server or receiver name. The name entered in this section is used for identification of the server/receiver within the program, and the program will also use this name when configuring notification templates.

**IP address/domain name**: CMS server or receiver IP address or domain name. When a SIM card with a private APN is used, and the given server or receiver is not in the same APN, it is necessary to enable access of the server/receiver IP address in the given APN.

**Port**: CMS server or receiver communication port number.

**Protocol**: select the appropriate communication protocol for the given server or receiver from the drop-down menu. Available protocols: **TELLMon** (custom TELL protocol), **TEX** (custom TELL protocol), **SIA IP** (SIA DC-09).

**Supervision message**: enable/disable supervision message sending. Supervision message sending cannot be disabled in case of using the TEX or the TELLMon communication protocol.

**Supervision message interval / Unit of measure**: if supervision message sending is enabled, you can configure the sending interval and unit of measure. The supervision message sending interval can be configured from 10 seconds to 30 minutes.

**Time zone:** in this section you can select whether the given server or receiver sends the timestamp used for synchronizing the system time in **UTC** or **local time**. It is important to select the appropriate option for each server and receiver, since if the system time is set incorrectly, events will be stored with the wrong timestamp.

**Network protocol**: according to the chosen communication protocol you can use **TCP** or **UDP**  network protocol. The **UDP** protocol allows for less data traffic. For the **TEX** communication protocol only the **TCP** network protocol option is available.

**AES key**: the custom AES encryption key can be used for SIA IP protocol only. If an encryption key is configured, the SIA IP packages will be encrypted with the given key and they have to be decrypted on the receiver side using the same key. The maximum length of the AES key is up to 16 characters, or up to 32 characters in case of using hexadecimal format.

**Send each message in a new session:** if required for the given receiver, for the **SIA IP** protocol it can be enabled to send each message in a new TCP session. In case of using UDP, the device will open a new port for each message, if this option is enabled.

# **Backup reporting to CMS via SMS:**

In case that the device fails to report the connected alarm system's messages to the CMS servers or receivers, as a backup solution, it is possible to forward the reports via SMS to a configurable phone number. For this, it is necessary to enable the "*Backup reporting via SMS*" option in the notification template assigned to the affected events.

**Phone number**: the CMS phone number where you want to forward the reports via SMS. It is recommended to enter the phone number in international format (e.g.: +3630…).

**Message**: the text of the message for backup reporting. This can be a specific custom message, or you can use the variables supported by the device, which the device will replace automatically with the data of the report received from the alarm system, as follows:

**\$cn**: event name, **\$cp**: partition name, **\$cz**: zone name,

**\$cid**: the complete Contact ID message (e.g. 123418113001001).

Further information about variables are available in paragraph "*[Alarm system events](#page--1-31)*".

#### **User phone number settings:**

You can configure up to 4 user phone numbers (**TEL1** to **TEL4**) to which the device sends notifications by voice call or SMS. Depending on the settings, the device can forward calls received from these numbers to the simulated phone line output.

**Name**: user name. The name entered in this section will be used when selecting the notification channels upon configuring events.

**Phone number**: user phone number. It is recommended to enter the phone number in international format (e.g.: +3630…).

**Event acknowledgement options**: when the device sends a notification by call, it requires a confirmation that the notification has been received, otherwise it will retry to deliver the notification. In this section you can configure the actions required from each user for acknowledging upon receiving a notification by voice call. Available options:

- **Accept call to acknowledge**: notifications will be acknowledged automatically upon accepting the calls. After accepting the call, wait at least 3 seconds before ending the call.
- **Reject or accept call to acknowledge**: notifications will be acknowledged automatically if the calls are rejected by user, and also if the calls are accepted.
- **Press to acknowledge**: notifications have to be acknowledged by pressing the star () key on the phone after accepting the call. The device will confirm that it has received the command by a short signal tone.
- **Press to acknowledge or # to stop notification**: notifications have to be acknowledged by pressing the star () key on the phone after accepting the call. The device will confirm that it has received the command by a short signal tone. Notification of further users on the given event can be stopped by pressing the hash (**#**) key on the phone. The device will confirm that it has received this command by three short signal tones. By pressing the hash (**#**) key, this also confirms reception of the notification at the same time, so it is not necessary to press the star () key too.

By this option it is also possible to cancel all pending notifications for all events by entering the *device password***#** command (e.g. **1234#**) using the phone's keys. The superadmin and admin passwords are both accepted.

**Incoming call management**: in this section you can configure for each user what should the device do when it receives a call from the given user. Available options:

- **Forward calls to the simulated line**: calls received from the given phone number will be forwarded to the simulated phone line output. If a landline phone device is connected to the line output, the phone will ring and speech communication is possible after accepting the call.
- **Reject calls**: the device will reject calls received from the given phone number.

Regardless of this setting, when a call is received from a user phone number, a related service event is generated for which you can configure output control or notification sending.

# **E-mail notification recipients** (Adapter2 PRO only)**:**

You can configure up to 4 e-mail addresses (**MAIL1** to **MAIL4**) to which the device will send notification upon event occurrence, according to the event settings.

**Name**: user/recipient name. The name entered in this section will be used upon selecting the notification channels when configuring events.

**E-mail address**: user/recipient e-mail address. You can configure 1 e-mail address per user.

Notification templates should only be configured if reporting to CMS is needed. In this menu you can configure different templates according to which the device will send reports to CMS servers and receivers. For quick and easy setup, the device contains 2 built-in templates, named as "*DEFAULT*" and "*EMPTY*". The "*DEFAULT*" template cannot be deleted, but its configuration can be changed if needed. If you wish to add new notification templates, it is appropriate to do this prior to configuring events. Any template can be assigned to any event, thus reports can be directed to the desired servers and receivers, with the desired priorities. Servers/receivers are classified into two groups, primary and backup. When an event occurs, the given report will be sent to all servers and receivers configured as primary in the notification template associated with the given event. In case that none of the primary servers/receivers are available, the device will try to report to the servers/receivers configured as backup. The device will send the acknowledgement signal to the connected alarm control panel when the event is received and acknowledged by at least one of the servers or receivers.

The order of reporting to servers and receivers configured as backup in a template corresponds to the numbering (1 to 6) of the channels in the template. The priority depends on the classification of the configured servers/receivers (primary or backup). Primary servers/receivers will be notified first. Reports will be sent to all primary servers/receivers, while backup servers/receivers will only be notified if reporting to all primary ones fail. In this case, the device will try to report to the first highest priority backup server/receiver, and then, if this fails, to the second one, and so on.

Additionally, if a reporting channel fails, the devices will keep sending supervision messages to the given server/receiver by the configured supervision sending interval to check its availability, and will send the report as soon as it becomes available. The device will no longer try to report events for which reporting failed for more than 1 hour.

In case that the device fails to report the connected alarm system's messages to all configured CMS servers or receivers, as a backup solution, it is possible to forward the reports via SMS to a configurable phone number. For this, enable the "*Backup reporting via SMS*" option and configure the phone number and the message in the "*Reporting channels*" menu. Further information about this option you can find in paragraph "*[Reporting channels](#page--1-32)*".

Notification templates cannot be deleted while they are associated with an event. The system supports adding up to **10 notification templates**, including the built-in ones.

When set to **NO**, an input event will be generated when the open contact between the given input (**IN1**…**IN4**) and the **V-** terminal (or the **COM** terminal) becomes closed.

When set to **NC**, an input event will be generated when the closed contact between the given input (**IN1**…**IN4**) and the **V-** terminal (or the **COM** terminal) becomes open.

**Sensitivity / Unit of measure**: state changes of the input shorter than the value entered in this section with regard to activation of the input are ignored by the device. The unit of measure can also be selected (milliseconds, seconds or minutes). The sensitivity can be configured from 5 milliseconds to 1 hour.

**Restore sensitivity / Unit of measure**: state changes of the input shorter than the value entered in this section with regard to restoration of the input are ignored by the device. The unit of measure can also be selected (milliseconds, seconds or minutes). The sensitivity can be configured from 5 milliseconds to 1 hour.

**a change is made. For this, click on the "***Write***" button.**

## **Event**:

**Name**: custom name of the event. The name entered in this section is used for identification of the given event within the program and in the event logs. The name should not be longer than 20 characters, and the following characters cannot be used: ^ ~ < > = | \$ % " '.

**Event**: select an event from the available service events in the drop-down menu.

Available service events:

- **- GSM error**: this type of event is generated if the device loses the connection with the GSM network or it is unable to register on the GSM network for at least 60 seconds. A restore event is generated upon successful registration on the GSM network. Most common reasons for this type of error are the following: there is no SIM card installed in the device, or the card is not installed properly, the card is damaged, or the service is not available on the SIM card, low GSM signal, the GSM antenna is not connected, insufficient supply voltage/current.
- **- Mobile Internet error**: this type of event is generated if the device is unable to establish the Internet connection for at least 60 seconds. A restore event is generated when the Internet connection restores. Most common reasons for this type of error are the following: wrong APN configured, or the mobile Internet service is not enabled on the SIM card.

- **- Low supply voltage**: the device has built-in supply voltage monitoring function. Low supply voltage event is generated when the supply voltage level is continuously on, or drops below the configured low supply voltage threshold value, for at least 30 seconds. Low supply voltage restore event is generated when the supply voltage level is continuously on, or returns above the configured low supply voltage restore threshold value, for at least 30 seconds, after a "*Low supply voltage*" event. You can configure the threshold values in the event dialog window.
**Low voltage** threshold: In this section you can configure the threshold from 9.5V to 30V, at which the device will generate the "*Low supply voltage*" event.

**Voltage restore** threshold: In this section you can configure the threshold from 10 to 30V, at which the device will generate the "*Low supply voltage*" restore event.

- **- Output control by APP ID (1…4)**: this type of event is generated when the output of the device is controlled from one of the mobile devices (1 to 4) through the mobile application. Activating the output will generate a new event, while deactivating will generate a restore.
- **- Incoming call from user (1…4)**: this type of event is generated when the device receives a call from a user phone number configured in the device. The caller ID (phone number) should be presented in the call in order to be identified by the device via CLIP service.
- **- Incoming call from unknown number**: this type of event is generated when the device receives a call from a phone number which is not configured in the device as a user phone number, or a call received from a private number (with hidden caller ID).
- **- Periodic test report**: this type of event is used for supervising the operation of the device and it is generated automatically based on the settings below.

**Interval of sending** (1…168h): the interval of periodic test report sending. If you change this setting, make sure to click on the "*Periodic test report*" button found in the "*Status monitoring*" menu, in order to generate a test report and validate the new settings. Otherwise the next test report will still be sent based on the previous setting.

**Time of day** (hh:mm): the time of day for periodic test report sending.

- **- First data usage limit reached**: this type of event is generated when the device data usage reaches the limit configured in Megabytes in the "*First data usage limit warning*" field.
**Billing cycle date**: This field can be used to mark the day of the month on which the mobile service provider resets and bills the amount of data used for the current month.

**Data rounding unit**: This field can be used to configure the data rounding unit used by your mobile service provider. This value will strongly influence the device's monthly data usage. You can check the data rounding unit for your data plan in the general terms and conditions of your mobile service provider.

The "*Billing cycle date*" and "*Data rounding unit*" settings are common for the "*Second data usage limit warning*" and "*Second data usage limit warning*" service events, i.e. they use the same configured values. If you change these settings for one of the two events, they will change automatically for the other event as well.

- **- Second data usage limit reached**: this type of event is generated when the device data usage reaches the limit configured in Megabytes in the "*Second data usage limit warning*" field.
- **- Settings changed:** this type of event is generated when the Superadmin user changes a protected setting, that the Admin user has no access to. (which is disabled in the "*Admin access*" menu.)
- **- SMS sending daily limit reached**: this type of event is generated when the number of event SMS messages sent by the device on the given day reaches the value configured at the "*SMS sending daily limit*" option in the "*General*" device settings menu.
- **- SMS forwarding daily limit reached**: this type of event is generated when the number of incoming SMS messages forwarded by the device on the given day reaches the value configured at the "*SMS forwarding daily limit*" option in the "*General*" device settings menu.
- **- Daily call limit reached**: this type of event is generated when the number of calls initiated by the device on the given day reaches the value configured at the "*Daily limit for calls*" option in the "*General*" device settings menu.

**Type**: the type of the event which can be new or restore. New event will be generated when a service event occurs, and restore event will be generated when it restores. In the Contact ID protocol new event is indicated with 1 (or E), while restore is indicated with 3 (or R).

#### **Remote monitoring**:

In this section you can configure the Contact ID event code for reporting to CMS and can select the preconfigured notification template for the given event. The Contact ID event code should only be configured if reporting to CMS is used, otherwise select the notification template named "*EMPTY*".

**Event code**: in this section you can configure the 3-digit Contact ID event code, consisting of characters 0...9,A,B,C,D,E,F, which you wish to assign to the given event (e.g. 302 = battery fault).

**Partition**: in this section you can configure the 2-digit partition number which you want to assign to the given event, from 00 to 99.

**Zone**: in this section you can configure the 3-digit zone number which you want to assign to the given event, from 000 to 999.

**Notification template**: in this section you can select a preconfigured notification template which you want to use for the given event. If you want to use additional notification templates, these should be added prior to configuring the events. If you do not want to send a report to CMS on the given event, select the template named "*EMPTY*".

# **Output**:

In this section you can configure the output to be controlled when the given service event occurs.

**Output control mode**: in this section you can configure the control mode of the output.

Available options:

- **None**: the output will not be used.
- **Monostable**: the output will be activated for the time configured in the **"***Duration***"** section of the output parameter settings, then it will revert to normal state automatically. The duration can be configured from 5 milliseconds to 1 hour.
- **Bistable ON**: the output will be activated permanently and will change state only upon receiving a different command or upon power loss.
- **Bistable OFF**: the output will become deactivated.
- **State change**: the output will change state (if deactivated, it will become activated and if activated, it will become deactivated).
- **Pulse series**: the output can be controlled by pulse series as well. The number of pulse series can be configured from 1 up to 3. For each pulse it can be configured how long the output should be activated, how long should be deactivated, the number of repetitions and the pause between repetitions. The active periods can be configured from 5 milliseconds to 1 hour, the number of repetitions can be configured from 1 to 10, and the pause between pulses can be configured from 5 milliseconds to 1 hour too.

**Output parameter settings**: this option becomes available if an output control mode is selected which has further settings. In this section you can configure the additional settings of specific output control modes, such as timings for monostable control and pulse series. Click on the "*Edit*" button to open the parameter configuration window.

In this menu you can configure custom events, which the device generates upon receiving a custom command by text message (SMS). You can freely configure the custom command for each event. Just like input and service events, custom events enable sending reports to remote monitoring station, notifications to users, as well as controlling the output.

With this function you can practically generate any reports to remote monitoring station, notifications to users, and also control the device's output, by sending custom commands of your choice in a text message (SMS) to the device's phone number.

**Attention! Custom commands must be different than the available default SMS commands (see paragraph** *[Remote connecting to devices via cloud service](#page--1-0)***), otherwise the device will only perform the default action associated with the command.**

It is possible to send more than one command in one message, but the message should not exceed 60 characters. The device will not execute commands which are entered in the message beyond the 60 characters limit. The device will not react in case of receiving an incorrect or non-existing command.

**PWD:** the device password can be specified using this parameter. The superadmin and admin passwords are both accepted (default superadmin password: 1234). The **PWD** is an optional parameter which should be used only when sending commands from phone numbers which are not configured in the device in the *Reporting channels* menu, in the *User phone number settings* section – such phone numbers are considered unauthorized, therefore in this case the password is required. If the device password is not specified along with the control command sent from unauthorized phone numbers, the command will not be executed by the device.

Commands sent from unauthorized phone numbers should always begin with a star "" and end with a hash "**#**" character.

# **Example on using custom commands:**

The following custom commands will be used in the example: Alert, Open

- **When sending from authorized phone numbers:**
- **-** Sending one command: **Alert** or **Alert#**
- **-** Sending multiple commands: **Alert,Open** or **Alert Open** or **Alert,Open#**
- **When sending from unauthorized phone numbers:**
- **-** Sending one command: **Alert,PWD=***1234***#** or **Alert#PWD=***1234***#**
- **-** Sending multiple commands: **Alert,Open,PWD=***1234***#** or

**Alert#Open#PWD=***1234***#**

After changing the settings or entering new settings, in order to take effect, it is necessary to write the new settings into the device by clicking on the "*Write*" button. This will write the changes only, but all changes made in any menu.

**Please note that the settings have to be written in the device in order to be applied after a change is made. For this, click on the "***Write***" button.**

#### **Camera settings:**

**Name**: in this section you can enter a custom name for your camera. The name entered in this section can be used to identify the cameras upon assigning them to events when configuring events.

**URL**: the picture path (link) of the IP cameras (**CAM1** and **CAM2**). You can enter the stream (live picture) or snapshot URL. The mobile application will show the live picture or the snapshot accordingly. Viewing a live picture generates higher data traffic on the mobile device.

There are multiple methods to obtain the camera URLs. You can use the "*IP Camera Detector*" software developed by the manufacturer (available on the manufacturer's website: [www.tell.hu)](http://www.tell.hu/), the "*ONVIF Device Manager*" software [(http://sourceforge.net/projects/onvifdm)](http://sourceforge.net/projects/onvifdm), or the camera's own software or technical manual.

**In order to access the camera pictures from outside your local network it is necessary to replace the local IP address and port in the URL obtained using the ONVIF camera detector program, with the external (WAN) IP address of your router and the external port, and after this enter the modified URL in the** *Adapter2* **programming software.**

Example for modification of the stream URL, if using only one camera: **Original URL:** rtsp://192.168.1.240:554/cam/realmonitor?channel=1&subtype=0&unicast=true&proto=Onvif

**Modified URL in case of using static IP address:** rtsp://*WAN IP*:554/cam/realmonitor?channel=1&subtype=0&unicast=true&proto=Onvif

**Modified URL in case of using static IP address and username/password:** rtsp://*username:password@WAN IP*:554/cam/realmonitor?channel=1&subtype….

**Modified URL in case of using domain name:** rtsp://*domain name*:554/cam/realmonitor?channel=1&subtype=0&unicast=true&proto=Onvif

**Modified URL in case of using domain name and username/password:** rtsp://*username:password@domain name*:554/cam/realmonitor?channel=1&subtype….

Further details and information on router configuration, port forwarding and dyndns configuration you can find in the "*Reference guide to the ONVIF camera support function*" document.

### **5.2.10 Voice messages**

In this menu you can upload audio files used for notifications via voice calls, and you can also configure a custom name for each voice message.

In this menu you can configure permissions for the Admin user to access protected settings. The Admin user can only modify the settings enabled in the list. The Admin access options can only be configured by the Superadmin.

The settings that don't have a checkmark, i.e. the ones that the Admin user does not have access to, are considered protected. In order to keep track of the changes made to the protected settings, the device generates a "*Settings changed*" service event if configured in the *"Service events"*  menu, whenever the Superadmin makes any changes to any of these protected settings.

Available options:

- Reading the settings from the device:
	- To read the settings from the device, click on the "*Read*" button. This will read all settings in all menus.
- Writing the settings into the device:

In this menu you can configure advanced settings which affect communication to CMS over DTMF-based voice call and the in-call volume for calls to users (siren tone, voice messages). Special DTMF communication parameters can be configured in order to adjust signals in case of experiencing problems with reporting to CMS over DTMF-based voice call. The default mobile operator and network to be used by the modem and device lock settings can also be configured here.

#### **Recommended for experts only! Do not change the factory default settings unless necessary!**

Available options:

- Reading the settings from the device:
	- To read the settings from the device, click on the "*Read*" button. This will read all settings in all menus.

![](_page_60_Picture_1.jpeg)

when you want to select a certain operator in the "*Operator selection*" drop-down menu in order to force the modem to use the given operator. After clicking on this button, the device will restart the modem and will reconnect to the mobile network in order to start operator searching. The search process may take up to 3 minutes. The end of the process will be indicated by a pop-up message, after which the list of available operators in the "*Operator selection*" drop-down menu will be updated automatically according to the search results.

To search mobile operators, click on the "*Search operators*" button. This is needed

# **Please note that the settings have to be written in the device in order to be applied after**

**a change is made. For this, click on the "***Write***" button.**

#### **Volume**:

**Microphone (outgoing CID)**: adjusts the microphone volume, which makes outgoing tones (Contact ID) louder or softer in voice calls. The value can be set from 1 to 15.

**Speaker (incoming HSK)**: adjusts the speaker volume, which makes incoming tones (HSK and ACK) louder or softer in voice calls. The value can be set from 1 to 100.

# **Note! Even minor changes of the values result significant tone volume changes!**

#### **Network management**:

**Operator selection**: using this drop-down menu you can select a mobile operator available with the given SIM card. In order to get the list of available operators, you have to click on the "*Search* 

*operators*" button. If you select and set an operator, the device will use only the selected operator's network. Please note that the search results may also contain operators which are not supported by your SIM card. If you accidentally select an unsupported operator, the device will use the default operator chosen automatically.

In the list of available operators the program will indicate which networks (2G/3G/4G) of the given operators are available with the given SIM card, in the given location and with the given product model (it depends on the type of the modem). The default setting is the "*Automatic*", i.e. the device will automatically choose the operator preferred by the given SIM card.

| Operator    | 2G | 3G | 4G |
|-------------|----|----|----|
| Automatic   |    |    |    |
| Telekom HU  | >  | V  |    |
| Telenor HU  | V  | V  |    |
| vodafone HU | V  | V  |    |

**Network selection**: mobile network management in the device is automatic by default. If you experience problems with the stability of the mobile network in the given location, that is the device switches frequently between networks, you can select the network you wish to use manually.

Available options:

- **Automatic**: the device will select the network automatically.
- **2G only**: use 2G (GPRS) network only.
- **3G only**: use 3G (UMTS) network only
- **4G only**: use 4G (LTE) network only

#### **3G network usage is supported by the 3G(A).IN4.R1 and the 4G(A).IN4.R1 model of the Adapter2 only! LTE network usage is supported by the 4G(A).IN4.R1 model only!**

**Use automatic selection upon network errors**: if this option is enabled, the device will select an available network when service error occurs, even if the use of a specific network is selected in the settings (2G, 3G, or LTE).

## **Locking the device**:

**Status**: you can lock your device with this setting, so that the factory default settings cannot be restored without knowing the device password.

- **Unlocked**: when unlocked, the factory default settings can be restored at anytime, also without knowing the device password.
- **Locked**: when locked, restoring the factory default settings is disabled. You can restore the factory default settings only after logging in with the Superadmin or Admin password and changing the setting to unlocked. If you forget these passwords, only the manufacturer can restore the factory default settings in the service center.

The "*Alarm system events*" menu can be used to filter Contact-ID event codes received from the alarm control panel connected to the device. For each event filter added you can configure separately which notification template to use for reporting to monitoring station, which user to notify by call, SMS, Push notification or email and what message to send, and to control or not the output when the given event code is received from the alarm control panel, or an event code is received which matches the conditions configured in the given event filter.

When entering the event code, partition and zone, you can use the "" character to define a group of events. This means that when any hexadecimal number is received from the alarm control panel in the place of the "" character written in the code, but the rest of the event code matches the event received from the alarm control panel, the given event will be processed. When receiving an event code from the alarm control panel, the device compares the received event with the event filters added to the table and if it finds a matching one, it performs the reporting and output control according to the settings of the given alarm system event filter. The device compares the events starting with the event type, then the event code, and finally with the partition and zone, in this order.

The device chooses in each case the added alarm system event filter which matches best the event code received from the alarm control panel. For example if it finds two added alarm system event filters at which the event type, the event code and the partition matches the event received from the alarm control panel, but at one of them the zone section matches too, while at the other one the zone section is filled in with "" characters, so the received event matches both alarm system event filters, the device will choose the one at which the zone section matches too.

If an event code is received from the alarm control panel which does not match any of the event filters configured, i.e. the device cannot find a reporting configuration for the given event code, then it will report the given event to CMS automatically using the notification template named "*DEFAULT*" to ensure that all events are reported.

If you wish to report only specific events to CMS, add a filter that applies to all events, where choose the "*New event, Restore, Repeat*" option for event type and fill the event code, partition and zone number fields with "" characters, and select for this the notification template named "*EMPTY*". With this, reporting to CMS of any event received from the alarm control panel will be disabled. Thereafter, configure and add the events you wish to be reported. In this case only the specified events will be reported and the device will send the kissoff (ACK) signal to the alarm control panel for all other events, but will not report them to CMS.

The system supports adding up to **500** alarm system event filters.

Using the event code search tool, you can search for events by name or by event code. For searching by name, start typing the name of the searched event code in the field under the "*Specification*" column header. For searching by event code, start typing the searched event code number in the field under the "*Event code*" column header. The search tool will filter the list automatically according to the hits. You can select an event code by clicking on it in the list, then the program will paste this automatically into the event code input field after clicking on the "*OK*" button.

**Partition**: in this section you can configure the partition number consisting of characters 00…99, or "", which you wish to filter from the messages coming from the alarm control panel.

**Zone**: in this section you can configure the zone number consisting of characters 000…999, or "", which you wish to filter from the messages coming from the alarm control panel.

**Notification template**: in this section you can select a preconfigured notification template which you want to use for the given event. If you want to use additional notification templates, these should be added prior to configuring the events. If you do not want to send a report to CMS on the given event, select the template named "*EMPTY*".

# **Output**:

The table found in the "*Custom event code names*" menu contains the default Contact ID event codes and event names. If needed, you can rename the events generated by the connected alarm control panel, or add new custom events if your alarm control panel would use an evet code that is missing from the event code table of the device. The device can use the event code names displayed here in text-notifications (SMS, Push, e-mail). The **\$***cn* variable written in the text of the message will be replaced by the device automatically with the event name associated in the table with the event code received from the alarm control panel, when sending the message. This will result in the message being received with the specific name of the event instead of the raw event code.

You can record altogether up to **370** custom event codes and default event code name changes in the system.

**User related event type**: this setting is used to qualify an event as user related or zone related. If the checkbox is enabled, the device will consider the given event as user related, and if it is disabled, the event will be considered as zone related. This option is relevant when you use the **\$cz** variable in messages, which the device will replace with a configured custom user name or zone name. The device can decide from this setting, whether it has to replace the variable in the message with a user name or a zone name, when it reports the given event via text message.

Available options:

- Reading the settings from the device:
To read the settings from the device, click on the "*Read*" button. This will read all settings in all menus.

- Writing the settings into the device:

- To delete the selected custom event code, click on the "*Delete*" button.
- Saving the custom event code names database to file:

To save the custom event code names to file in csv format, click on the "*Save to file*" button.

- Adding custom event code names from file:
It is possible to add custom event code names from a csv file prepared in advance. To add custom event code names from file, click on the "*Add from file*" button, browse the file, and then click on the "*Import*" button. By this, the program will read the entries from the selected file and will prepare an import summary. The event code names stored in the device will not be deleted by adding entries from file, but the imported entries will be added to the existing ones.

The structure requirements of the CSV file to be imported:

#### **The program considers the first line of the CSV file as the header, therefore it will not process the firs line!**

The file should contain the entries starting from the second line. The line should start with the 3-digit event code, followed by the event type indicator (**0**=zone related event, **1**=user related event), the custom new event name, and then the custom restore event name, each separated by a semicolon. Example:

148;0;Custom sensor alarm;Custom sensor restore

436;1;User access granted;User access denied

The easiest way to prepare the file is exporting the custom event code names database from the program using the "*Save to file*" button, and then edit the exported file and enter the desired custom data in the file by the analogy of the file content, and finally delete the original entries from the file.

The program will indicate, if there are issues in the file to be imported, e.g. duplicate event codes, or event codes which already exist in the device in that particular case, or other entries that the program cannot process.

The program classifies the entries into 3 categories, which you can find in the "*Type*" column, and marks each with a different background color for better transparency:

**Information** (green background color): entries imported successfully.

**Warning** (yellow background color): entries processed successfully, but the event code appears more than once in the file, or already exists among the entries registered in the device, or the event code or event name is missing.

**Error** (red background color): entries with errors, which the program cannot process.

#### **The program will not import entries marked as "***Warning***" or "***Error***" into the system!**

You can find a summary line at the bottom of the list, showing the number of entries imported successfully, the ones marked as warnings, and the ones with errors. You can close the window by clicking on the "*Close*" button, after which the entries imported successfully will show up in the list of custom event code names. After that, you can edit and continue to configure the entries imported into the program as needed, and when finished, write the settings into the device by clicking on the

"*Write*" button.

**Please note that the settings have to be written in the device in order to be applied after**

**a change is made. For this, click on the "***Write***" button.**

In the "*Custom user names*" menu you can associate names with users configured in the alarm control panel, by the user number. The device can use the custom user names configured here in text-notifications (SMS, Push, e-mail). The *\$cz* variable written in the text of the message will be replaced by the device automatically with the user name associated with the user number received from the alarm control panel, when the device reports a user related event. This will result in the message being received with the specific name of the user instead of the raw user number. The user related events can be configured in the "*Custom event code names*" menu.

If a custom user name has not been configured for the given user number, the device will replace the variable with the user number in the message. (e.g.: 001).

The system can store up to **50** custom user names.

The structure requirements of the CSV file to be imported:

#### **The program considers the first line of the CSV file as the header, therefore it will not process the firs line!**

The file should contain the entries starting from the second line. The line should start with the 3-digit user number, followed by a semicolon, and then the user name. Example:

001;L. Taylor 002;J. Smith

The easiest way to prepare the file is adding at least one custom user name in the program, and then export it to csv file using the "*Save to file*" button, and then edit the exported file and enter the further custom user names in the file by the analogy of the file content.

The program will indicate, if there are issues in the file to be imported, e.g. duplicate user numbers, or user numbers that already exist in the device in that particular case, or other entries that the program cannot process.

The program classifies the entries into 3 categories, which you can find in the "*Type*" column, and marks each with a different background color for better transparency:

**Information** (green background color): entries imported successfully.

**Warning** (yellow background color): entries processed successfully, but the user number appears more than once in the file, or already exists among the entries registered in the device, or the user number or user name is missing.

**Error** (red background color): entries with errors, which the program cannot process.

#### **The program will not import entries marked as "***Warning***" or "***Error***" into the system!**

You can find a summary line at the bottom of the list, showing the number of entries imported successfully, the ones marked as warnings, and the ones with errors. You can close the window by clicking on the "*Close*" button, after which the entries imported successfully will show up in the list of custom user names. After that, you can edit and continue to configure the entries imported into the program as needed,

and when finished, write the settings into the device by clicking on the "*Write*" button.

# **Please note that the settings have to be written in the device in order to be applied after**

**a change is made. For this, click on the "***Write***" button.**

#### **5.3.4 Custom partition names**

In the "*Custom partition names*" menu you can associate names with partitions configured in the alarm control panel, by the partition number. The device can use the custom partition names configured here in text-notifications (SMS, Push, e-mail). The **\$***cp* variable written in the text of the message will be replaced by the device automatically with the partition name associated with the partition number received from the alarm control panel, when sending the message. This will result in the message being received with the specific name of the partition instead of the raw partition number.

If a custom partition name has not been configured for the given partition number, the device will replace the variable with the partition number in the message. (e.g.: 01).

The system can store up to **20** custom partition names.

The structure requirements of the CSV file to be imported:

#### **The program considers the first line of the CSV file as the header, therefore it will not process the firs line!**

The file should contain the entries starting from the second line. The line should start with the 2-digit partition number, followed by a semicolon, and then the partition name. Example:

- 01;Basement 02;Ground floor
The easiest way to prepare the file is adding at least one custom partition name in the program, and then export it to csv file using the "*Save to file*" button, and then edit the exported file and enter the further custom partition names in the file by the analogy of the file content.

The program will indicate, if there are issues in the file to be imported, e.g. duplicate partition numbers, or partition numbers that already exist in the device in that particular case, or other entries that the program cannot process.

The program classifies the entries into 3 categories, which you can find in the "*Type*" column, and marks each with a different background color for better transparency:

**Information** (green background color): entries imported successfully.

**Warning** (yellow background color): entries processed successfully, but the partition number appears more than once in the file, or already exists among the entries registered in the device, or the partition number or partition name is missing.

**Error** (red background color): entries with errors, which the program cannot process.

#### **The program will not import entries marked as "***Warning***" or "***Error***" into the system!**

You can find a summary line at the bottom of the list, showing the number of entries imported successfully, the ones marked as warnings, and the ones with errors. You can close the window by clicking on the "*Close*" button, after which the entries imported successfully will show up in the list of custom partition names. After that, you can edit and continue to configure the entries imported into the program as needed, and when finished, write the settings into the device by clicking on the

"*Write*" button.

**Please note that the settings have to be written in the device in order to be applied after a change is made. For this, click on the "***Write***" button.**

#### **5.3.5 Custom zone names**

In the "*Custom zone names*" menu you can associate names with zones configured in the alarm control panel, by the zone number. The device can use the custom zone names configured here in text-notifications (SMS, Push, e-mail). The **\$***cz* variable written in the text of the message will be replaced by the device automatically with the zone name associated with the zone number received from the alarm control panel, when the device reports a zone related event. This will result in the message being received with the specific name of the zone instead of the raw zone number.

If a custom zone name has not been configured for the given zone number, the device will replace the variable with the zone number in the message. (e.g.: 001).

The system can store up to **100** custom zone names.

Available options:

- Reading the settings from the device:
To read the settings from the device, click on the "*Read*" button. This will read all settings in all menus.

- Writing the settings into the device:
![](_page_77_Picture_4.jpeg)

After changing the settings or entering new settings, in order to take effect, it is necessary to write the new settings into the device by clicking on the "*Write*" button. This will write the changes only, but all changes made in any menu.

- Adding a new custom zone name:
![](_page_77_Picture_7.jpeg)

- To add a new custom zone name, click on the "*New*" button.
- Creating a copy of an existing custom zone name:

To create a copy of the selected custom zone name, click on the "*Clone*" button. Please note that the new copy should have a different unique zone number.

- Editing a custom zone name:
![](_page_77_Picture_12.jpeg)

To edit the selected custom zone name, click on the "*Edit*" button.

- Deleting a custom zone name:
![](_page_77_Picture_15.jpeg)

![](_page_77_Picture_17.jpeg)

To delete the selected custom zone name, click on the "*Delete*" button.

- Saving the custom zone names database to file:
To save the custom zone names to file in csv format, click on the "*Save to file*" button.

- Adding custom zone names from file:
It is possible to add custom zone names from a csv file prepared in advance. To add custom zone names from file, click on the "*Add from file*" button, browse the file, and then click on the "*Import*" button. By this, the program will read the entries from the selected file and will prepare an import summary. If there are already custom zone names stored in the device, those will not be deleted by adding entries from file, but the imported zone names will be added to the existing ones.

The structure requirements of the CSV file to be imported:

#### **The program considers the first line of the CSV file as the header, therefore it will not process the firs line!**

The file should contain the entries starting from the second line. The line should start with the 3-digit zone number, followed by a semicolon, and then the zone name. Example:

001;Entrance 002;Living room

The easiest way to prepare the file is adding at least one custom zone name in the program, and then export it to csv file using the "*Save to file*" button, and then edit the exported file and enter the further custom zone names in the file by the analogy of the file content.

The program will indicate, if there are issues in the file to be imported, e.g. duplicate zone numbers, or zone numbers that already exist in the device in that particular case, or other entries that the program cannot process.

The program classifies the entries into 3 categories, which you can find in the "*Type*" column, and marks each with a different background color for better transparency:

**Information** (green background color): entries imported successfully.

**Warning** (yellow background color): entries processed successfully, but the zone number appears more than once in the file, or already exists among the entries registered in the device, or the zone number or zone name is missing.

**Error** (red background color): entries with errors, which the program cannot process.

#### **The program will not import entries marked as "***Warning***" or "***Error***" into the system!**

You can find a summary line at the bottom of the list, showing the number of entries imported successfully, the ones marked as warnings, and the ones with errors. You can close the window by clicking on the "*Close*" button, after which the entries imported successfully will show up in the list of custom zone names. After that, you can edit and continue to configure the entries imported into the program as needed,

and when finished, write the settings into the device by clicking on the "*Write*" button.

# **Please note that the settings have to be written in the device in order to be applied after**

**a change is made. For this, click on the "***Write***" button.**

# **6 Transparent serial port**

The serial port of the device is suitable for bidirectional transparent data transfer over the Internet. It can be used for e.g. remote programming of the connected alarm control panel or can provide a solution for remote communication of other devices or equipment which are using an RS232 serial port. The Internet connection between the remote device or equipment and the computer is ensured by the *Adapter2* and the *Remote Serial Client* software. For this, the serial port of the *Adapter2* should be connected to the serial port of the given device or equipment, and then data can be sent to and received from the device or equipment on the PC through the virtual serial port created by the *Remote Serial Client* software.

# **6.1 Remote programming of alarm control panels**

For remote programming, the device establishes transparent serial data communication through IP connection. The remote connection between the programming software of the alarm system and the alarm control panel is ensured by the *Adapter2* device and the *Remote Serial Client* software. For this, the serial port of the *Adapter2* should be connected to the serial port of the alarm control panel, and the programming software of the alarm system connects to the virtual serial port created by the *Remote Serial Client* software.

**Attention!** The transparent serial data transfer works through the cloud service only. Therefore, in order to use this function it is necessary for the device to be connected to the cloud server.

#### **Attention! Please note that data transfer through the serial port of the** *Adapter2* **may generate high data traffic, which may result in an increased data usage on the SIM card installed in the device.**

Remote programming was tested with the following alarm control panels:

- Paradox EVO192, SP5500, SP4000
- DSC NEO HS2016, PC1616
- Texecom Premier, Premier Elite
- Bentel KYO 8
- Inim Ability, Smart Living
- Satel CA-10

## **6.1.1 Paradox alarm systems**

## **Installation:**

![](_page_89_Figure_2.jpeg)

For Paradox alarm control panels a level driver interface is needed to establish the serial link. TELL offers its own level driver interface produced for this purpose. Connect the serial port output of the level driver interface to the serial port of the *Adapter2*, then link the level driver interface with the alarm control panel using the supplied special cable, as shown in the figure above. Configure the jumpers of the driver level interface as well as shown in the figure above.

#### **Software settings:**

Configure the serial port settings in the "*Serial port*" section of the "*General*" menu, in the *Adapter2* programming software, as shown in the figure below.

For Spectra alarm control panels: Baud rate=9600, Parity=None, Stopbits=1 For EVO alarm control panels: Baud rate=57600, Parity=None, Stopbits=1

| Parity | Stop bits |  |
|--------|-----------|--|
| None   | 0.3       |  |
|        |           |  |

In order to establish the connection between the alarm control panel and its programming software, it is necessary to install the *Remote Serial Client* software. This client software ensures the connection between the PC and the *Adapter2* device, as well as it creates a virtual serial port for the programming software of the alarm system.

#### **6.1.2 DSC alarm systems**

**Installation:**

![](_page_93_Figure_2.jpeg)

Connect the supplied special cable to the serial port of the *Adapter2* device as shown in the figure above, then plug it onto the alarm control panel.

#### **Software settings:**

Configure the serial port settings in the "*Serial port*" section of the "*General*" menu, in the *Adapter2* programming software, as shown in the figure below (Baud rate=9600, Parity=None, Stopbits=1):

| Serial port |        |           |  |
|-------------|--------|-----------|--|
| Baud rate   | Parity | Stop bits |  |
| 9600        | None   | 0.1 880   |  |

In order to establish the connection between the alarm control panel and its programming software, it is necessary to install the *Remote Serial Client* software. This client software ensures the connection between the PC and the *Adapter2* device, as well as it creates a virtual serial port for the programming software of the alarm system.

Open the *Remote Serial Client* software and configure the settings in the order below:

**Device ID**: enter the device identifier (6x2 hexadecimal characters separated by colons) of the *Adapter2* device connected to the alarm control panel.

Using the "*Read from QR code*" button, you can also read the device ID from the image file saved from the programming software, that contains the QR code with the device ID.

**Virtual serial port**: enter the number of the virtual port you wish to create (e.g.: COM6).

**System logs**: shows information about program operation and displays data received through the serial port.

**Create port**: click on this button to create the configured virtual serial port, then select the created port in at the serial communication settings in the programming software of the alarm system. Please note that the *Adapter2* device should be online in order to create the virtual serial port.

Example for selecting the serial communication port in the *DLS 5* programming software:

# **6.1.3 Premier and Premier Elite alarm systems**

- **Installation:**
![](_page_96_Figure_2.jpeg)

For Premier alarm control panels a level driver interface is needed to establish the serial link. TELL offers its own level driver interface produced for this purpose. Connect the serial port output of the level driver interface to the serial port of the *Adapter2*, then link the level driver interface with the alarm control panel using the supplied special cable, as shown in the figure above. Configure the jumpers of the driver level interface as well as shown in the figure above.

# **Software settings:**

Configure the serial port settings in the "*Serial port*" section of the "*General*" menu, in the *Adapter2* programming software, as shown in the figure below (Baud rate=19200, Parity=None, Stopbits=2):

In order to establish the connection between the alarm control panel and its programming software, it is necessary to install the *Remote Serial Client* software. This client software ensures the connection between the PC and the *Adapter2* device, as well as it creates a virtual serial port for the programming software of the alarm system.

Open the *Remote Serial Client* software and configure the settings in the order below:

**Device ID**: enter the device identifier (6x2 hexadecimal characters separated by colons) of the *Adapter2* device connected to the alarm control panel.

Using the "*Read from QR code*" button, you can also read the device ID from the image file saved from the programming software, that contains the QR code with the device ID.

**Virtual serial port**: enter the number of the virtual port you wish to create (e.g.: COM6).

**System logs**: shows information about program operation and displays data received through the serial port.

**Create port**: click on this button to create the configured virtual serial port, then select the created port in at the serial communication settings in the programming software of the alarm system. Please note that the *Adapter2* device should be online in order to create the virtual serial port.

Example for selecting the serial communication port in the *Wintex* programming software:

Open the *Remote Serial Client* software and configure the settings in the order below:

**Device ID**: enter the device identifier (6x2 hexadecimal characters separated by colons) of the *Adapter2* device connected to the alarm control panel.

Using the "*Read from QR code*" button, you can also read the device ID from the image file saved from the programming software, that contains the QR code with the device ID.

**Virtual serial port**: enter the number of the virtual port you wish to create (e.g.: COM6).

**System logs**: shows information about program operation and displays data received through the serial port.

**Create port**: click on this button to create the configured virtual serial port, then select the created port in at the serial communication settings in the programming software of the alarm system. Please note that the *Adapter2* device should be online in order to create the virtual serial port.

# **7 Arming and disarming the alarm control panel through the mobile application**

It is possible to arm and disarm the connected alarm control panel via the mobile application if the given alarm control panel can be armed and disarmed by dry relay contact pulses through one of its inputs. This option is only available for the **Adapter2 PRO** variant. To use this feature, connect the relay output (**OUT** and **COM**) of the **Adapter2** to the alarm control panel's arming and disarming input, set the given input in the alarm control panel to normally open (**NO**) pulse control, and then configure the "*Output control by APP ID (1… 4)*" service event as follows:

- **-** Read the settings from the device by clicking on the "*Read*" button.
- **-** Click on the "*New*" button in the "*Service events*" menu.
- **-** Enter a name for the event into the "*Name*" field.
- **-** In the "*Event*" drop-down menu, select the "*Output control by APP ID (1… 4)*" according to the number of the registered mobile device (1...4), which you want to arm and disarm the alarm control panel with (see "*Mobile devices*" menu).
- **-** Select the "*New Event*" option from the "*Type*" drop-down menu.
- **-** Select the "*Monostable*" option from the "*Output control mode*" drop-down menu. (The duration may remain at the factory default of 1500 milliseconds).
- **-** Click the "*OK*" button, and then write the changes in the module using the "*Write*". button.

To arm and disarm the alarm control panel, activate the output of the **Adapter2** in the mobile application. Each output activation generates an "*Output control by APP ID (1… 4)*" service event that creates a short circuit between the **OUT** and **COM** terminals for the configured period of time (1.5 seconds), and then reverts to default open state automatically. Thereby the mobile application also resets the output control button to its default position.

# **8 Updating the firmware**

TELL always releases its products with the latest firmware version. However, as our products are being continuously improved, new firmware updates may occasionally be released for the products, which may include new features along with bug fixes. Therefore, it is recommended that you always upgrade your product to the latest firmware version available. All released firmware versions are available on the TELL website, including older versions.

#### **ATTENTION! Downgrading to an earlier version is not supported! Always upgrade your product to the latest version, otherwise your settings could get wiped due to differences in functionality between versions.**

You can update the firmware of your *Adapter2* device locally via USB, or remotely via the Internet. You can find the firmware file or the desktop update application needed for the update on the manufacturer's website [(https://tell.hu/en)](https://tell.hu/en) in the product downloads section.

# **8.1 Updating via USB**

You can update the firmware via USB using the desktop update tool (application) or the programming software.

# **Updating via USB using the desktop update application:**

- **-** Download the latest update tool (application with **.exe** extension) from the manufacturer's website. The update tool includes the firmware as well, therefore the file name is the same as the firmware version number.
- **-** Open the update tool and click on the "*FIRMWARE*" button.
- **-** Connect the device to the computer via USB.
- **-** Power up the device and then click on the "*Start*" button. Do not power down the device later on!
- **-** Wait until the progress bar shows that the process has completed.
- **-** Use the "*Cancel*" button to close the pop-up window that shows up while loading the firmware, with a question that asks if you want to format the drive.
- **-** You can close the update tool when the progress bar shows that the process has completed.
- **-** Wait until the LED status indicator on the device shows activity. You can then connect to the programming software and check the functioning.

# **Updating via USB using the programming software:**

- **-** Download the latest firmware file (that has the **.tf3** extension) necessary for updating, from the manufacturer's website.
- **-** Click on the "*General*" device settings menu in the programming software.
- **-** Click the "*Firmware update*" button, and then browse the **.tf3** firmware file.
- **-** The update process will start automatically as soon as you click on the "*Open*" button. Once the firmware is loaded, the progress window will close automatically and the device will restart in a few seconds, running on the new firmware.

# **8.2 Updating remotely over the internet**

It is also possible to remotely update the firmware of the *Adapter2* over the Internet, using the programming software. After establishing the remote connection, the steps for remote update are the same as the steps for updating through USB, as specified above.

# **9 Restoring the factory default settings**

Restoring the factory default settings will delete all settings and the event logs in the device, and will restore the factory default values, including the device password! Create a system backup if needed, before performing the factory reset.

The factory default settings cannot be restored if the device has been locked in the settings. If you have forgotten the device passwords, and the device is locked, only the manufacturer can restore the factory default settings in the service center.

You can restore the factory default settings using the programming software.

To restore the factory default settings, click on the "*Restore factory default settings*" button in the "*Connection type*" menu. The reset process may take more than 1 minute and it will restart the device. Wait until the device restarts and the status LED on the device shows activity again. The option of restoring the factory default settings is also available without entering the device passwords, but the reset cannot be performed if the device lock option has been enabled in the settings.
