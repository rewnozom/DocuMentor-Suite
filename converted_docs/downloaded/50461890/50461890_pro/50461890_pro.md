## **SpotScan**

# Active infrared presence detector for automatic doors

#### **Safe on the spot**

SpotScan has been proven as a really versatile all-rounder. In stationary operating mode it provides protection against entrapment at shearing edges of automatic revolving and swing doors. In the door ride-on type of application (mobile operating mode), it is installed as a collision prevention device. With sliding and curved sliding doors SpotScan monitors the main and secondary closing edges. Additionally it features a test input.

#### **For a wide range of applications**

Thanks to its compact design and the extensive accessory range the SpotScan can be adapted to suit any type of installation. It is suitable for counting people in confined spaces and picks-up the presence of objects or people on escalators and in elevators. Amongst other areas it can also be installed in making occupancy checks of people in security locks.

Concentrating on the importance of its design, SpotScan is really easy to understand and install. A screwdriver is all that's needed to adjust the optical scanning range of the sensor.

### Your benefits

#### **Multi-purpose adjustment with only three switches**

- As versatile the SpotScan is, as easy it is to be set up: only three switches are necessary to adust this sensor for the needs of the application. The type of operation, signal output and transmitting frequency are configured just using the three DIP switches at the front of the sensor. Depending on the installation height, the switching-point of the infrared light scanner can be adjusted for height up or down using the mechanical adjusting screw.

#### **Changing frequencies** (DIP switch 1)

Frequency selection 1 or 2 prevents two adjacent sensors from interfering with each other.

#### **Operating mode** (DIP switch 2)

The sensor can be optionally utilized for mobile or stationary operating mode using the background suppression or background analysis technology.

#### **Output switching mode** (DIP switch 3)

The output signal is switched active or passive depending on the type of control and application.
