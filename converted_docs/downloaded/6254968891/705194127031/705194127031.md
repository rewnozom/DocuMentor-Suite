### Installation

- **1.** Mark the centre line A (edge of door stile) when the position of the lock has been decided.
- **2.** Mark locations B and C.
- **3.** Using a Ø20 mm wood drill bit, drill a series of holes 82 mm deep for a spindle offset of 50 mm. Clean out the recess with a chisel so that the lock fits easily. Using a Ø42 mm drill bit, drill through the door for the cylinder hole and handle hole (B + C).

Using a chisel, cut a rebate 3 mm deep and 22 mm wide for the lock face plate. Mark out where the striking plate should sit. Drill six Ø22 mm holes 26 mm deep for 1487-X. Clean out with a chisel so that the striking plate fits the recess.

Chisel out a rebate for the face of the striking plate, 4 mm deep for 1487-X. Pre-drill the fixing holes for the screws (4 x Ø3 mm holes).

If you intend to use the internal door position sensor, fit the magnet to the striking plate. The magnet should sit at the same height as the datum mark on the lock face plate.

**ASSA ABBLOY recommends a gap of 3 mm between the lock stile and the striking plate. Adjust the door so that the door seal does not press on the hook bolt.**

### Connection

Connection to the Hi-O Bus is made using four cables: two for power and two for communication. For installation, use EA226 (10 m) cable with pre-installed connectors. The cable can be connected to any location on the Hi-O bus.3

### Setting up lock case and I/O Box

- **1** Connect the lock case to the I/O Box.
- **2** Set the function DIP switches on the lock case to the desired settings.
- **3** Connect power to the I/O Box; the LED will flash green/red to show that the power is on.
- **4** Set DIP switch 1 to ON. Set the configuration DIP switch 2 for the desired operation.
- **5** When the red LED glows steadily the Hi-O bus is secure and encrypted.

### Setting up lock case and DAC564/DAC530

- **1** Connect the lock case and DAC.
- **2** Make sure the termination jumper in DAC is in the ON position.
- **3** In most cases the Door monitor input should be fitted with a jumper and the Button input should be open. (For more information, see the setting-up table.)
- **4** Set all DIP switches to the OFF position for most applications. (For more information, see the setting-up table.)
- **5** Turn on the power. (Blue DWG LED starts flashing. Wait until blue DWG LED flashes rapidly, which can take up to 3 minutes. Do NOT turn off the power during setting up.)
- **6** Setting up is complete when the yellow PWR LED lights up and the blue LED flashes rapidly. (If the blue LED flashes rapidly and the yellow PWR LED does not light up then setting up has failed.)
- **7** Turn off the power.
- **8** Set DIP switch 8 to ON for standalone mode. Also see page 12 for different operating modes.
- **9** Turn the power back on and check operation.

### Factory reset

- **1** Hold the lock case and push the bolt in, for models 820, 825 and 835 (unlocked).
- **2** Turn off the power to the lock.
- **3** Check that the door sensor is not activated. DIP switch 2 should be OFF.
- **4** Turn on the power.
- **5** Toggle the group switch 6 times ON/OFF within 30 seconds.
- **6** When the LED glows steadily the lock has been reset to factory settings.

#### **LED operation**

Steady glow = Not set up; LED off = Set up. Flashing at 2 Hz = Set up for different DAC, or I/O Box flashing at 20 Hz (flickering) = Timeout, wait 240 seconds before unlocking.

#### **Conditions for deadlocking 820C/825C**

For 820C/825C you can set the condition for the lock to report deadlocking. This function can be used if you want to prevent unlocking from outside when the door is manually locked from inside. The condition is set using the DIP switch for hookbolt deadlock on the lock casing.

When the DIP switch is OFF the condition for deadlocking is the dead-latching snib. When the dip switch is ON the condition for deadlocking is latch locked.

### Important information and maintenance

The most important advice is to follow the installation instructions and not to deviate from them without first consulting us at ASSA ABLOY.

#### **The guarantee is invalidated if:**

- The product is incorrectly installed.
- The product is opened (seal is broken) or if cables/ connectors are cut off.
- The product is installed with accessories or parts that are not recommended by ASSA ABLOY.

#### **Maintenance:**

- Make sure that the fitted cylinders, thumb turns and handles work satisfactorily.
- Lubricate and/or adjust as needed with ASSA ABLOY's recommended lock grease.
- Electrical parts do not require any maintenance.
- Lubricate the bolt and latch in the lock case at least twice a year. Locks that are used very frequently require more frequent maintenance.
- It is also important to maintain and, if necessary, adjust the door closer and hinges to ensure the door closes properly. Correct maintenance of doors is essential for effective operation of locks.

#### **Important information**

- **•** Do not use lubricants that contain graphite or solvents; only use lock lubricant from ASSA ABLOY.
- The safety features of this product are vital for its compliance with EN 14846 and SSF3522-1093.
- No modification or alteration of any kind other than described in these instructions is permitted.
- The lock case is intended for installation in a single or double door **, made from wood, aluminium or steel. The door must not weigh more than 200 kg.
- Depending on the type of door, different mounting screws may be needed.
- * The fire test was performed on a glazed uninsulated door constructed from steel profiles. The lock tested was an 835C-50 model.
- ** If the lock is used in a double door, a door coordinator must be fitted.

### Class 3

The following requirements must be met to comply with class 3. To meet class 3 the DAC564 control unit or I/O Box 350 must be installed in a protected area that meets class 3 locking requirements or better. The DAC564 control unit or I/O Box 350 must be installed in SSF 3522 mode.

### SSF 3522 Mode

To configure 835C-50 in SSF 3522 mode, proceed as follows:

- **1** Set up the lock case
- **2** Turn off the power
- **3** Set DIP switch 3 to the ON position
- **4** Turn on the power

In SSF 3522 mode the relay will operate as follows:

- Deadlock relay lock indication is active for 15 seconds after locking.
- Inside handle relay is activated when the inside handle is down.
- Error relay is activated by the same fault, but is deactivated after 120 seconds.
- Forced relay indicates that door is unlocked; output is deactivated after 120 seconds.

### Accessories SSF 3522

All components that form part of the lock unit (including lock case, striking plate and door stiffening accessories) must meet the same classification or better in order for the lock unit to be classed as SSF 3522.

#### **Description of pairing sequence Pairing lock with I/O Box 350 on Hi-O bus**

- **1** Set the function DIP switches on the lock case to the desired settings.
- **2** Connect the Hi-O lock to I/O Box 350.
- **3** Turn on the power to I/O Box 350, flashing green and red LEDs indicate that power is on.
- **4** Set DIP switch 1 to the ON position. Set configuration. DIP switch 2 to suit the desired position. See the table.
- **5** The green LED will start flashing when set-up begins.
- **6** The red LED will glow steadily when set-up is complete.
- **7** When the green LED turns off and the red LED glows steadily the Hi-O bus is secure and encrypted.

At the top edge of the lock next to the DIP switches is a red LED which lights up when the lock is unpaired and turns off when the lock is paired and encrypted.
