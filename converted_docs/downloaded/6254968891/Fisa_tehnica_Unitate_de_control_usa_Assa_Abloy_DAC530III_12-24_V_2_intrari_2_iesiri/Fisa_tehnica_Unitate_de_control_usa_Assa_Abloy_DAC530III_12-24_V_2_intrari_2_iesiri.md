The DAC530III is a communication unit and an intelligent connection terminal block designed to be fitted next to each door environment. An electric lock, reader, exit button and so on are connected to each unit.

The DAC530III is a Hi-O™ unit that can be connected to a Hi-O bus, but it can also be used as a traditional DAC and connected to non-Hi-O units, such as a reader, electric lock and exit button.

Hi-O means that the units have a built-in processor and communicate with each other for plug-and-play installation. Hi-O enables intelligent supervision of door behavior, in real time.

The DAC530III has built-in function for Hi-O motor locks.
