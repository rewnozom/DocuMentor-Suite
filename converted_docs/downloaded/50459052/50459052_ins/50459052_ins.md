If triggered, GlassProtect immediately transmits the alarm signal to the , activating the (if connected) and notifying the user and security company. hub sirens

#### Connecting

#### Detector Connection to hub

#### **Before starting connection:**

- **1.** Following the hub user guide, install the . Create the account, add the hub, and create at least one room. Ajax app
- **2.** Switch on the hub and check the internet connection (via Ethernet cable and/or GSM network).
- **3.** Make sure that the hub is disarmed and does not update by checking its status in the Ajax app.

For detection and pairing to occur, the detector should be located within the coverage area of the wireless network of the hub (at a single protected object). The connection request is transmitted for a short time: at the moment of switching on the device.

If the device failed to pair (LED blinks once per second), switch it off for 5 seconds and retry. The detector connected to the hub appears in the list of devices in the app. The update of the detector statuses in the list depends on the device ping interval set in the hub settings (the default value is 36 seconds).

### Connecting to Third-Party Systems

To connect the detector to a third-party central unit using the or integration module, follow the recommendations in the user manual of the respective device. uartBridge ocBridge Plus

# How to set Chime

Chime is a sound signal that indicates the triggering of the opening detectors when the system is disarmed. The feature is used, for example, in stores, to notify employees that someone has entered the building.

Notifications are configured in two stages: setting up opening detectors and setting up sirens.

#### Learn more about Chime

#### **GlassProtect settings**

# Functionality testing

The Ajax security system allows conducting tests for checking the functionality of connected devices.

The tests do not start immediately but within a period of 36 seconds when using standard settings. The test time start depends on the settings of the detector ping interval (the paragraph on "**Jeweller**" settings in hub settings).

#### Jeweller Signal Strength Test

Detection Zone Test

Attenuation Test

### Detector functionality testing

Having defined the location of the detector and having fixed the device with the bundled adhesive tape, test the detection zone.

![](_page_12_Picture_6.jpeg)

GlassProtect does not react to clapping!

### Testing the detector

Hit the glass with your fist without breaking it. If the detector catches a lowfrequency sound, the LED blinks. Simulate a high-frequency glass shattering sound for 1.5 seconds after the first hit with a special tool or hitting a glass with a metal object. After recognizing the sound, the detector switches off the LED indicator for a second.

> To be triggered when the system is armed, the detector needs to recognize sounds in the following order: low-frequency sound (hit) firstly, then high-frequency sound (glass shattering, shards). Otherwise, the alarm will not go off.

Switch on/off all the appliances that usually operate in the room: generators, air conditioners, etc. If this triggers the detector, try to change the sensitivity or relocate GlassProtect.

Use the sensitivity level, at which the detector correctly passes both test stages and does not respond to any devices operating in the room.

#### Installing the device

### Selecting the Location

![](_page_13_Picture_2.jpeg)

In some cases, the household activity can cause false alarms

The location of GlassProtect depends on its remoteness from the hub, and obstacles hindering the radio signal transmission: walls, floors, large objects inside the room.

![](_page_13_Picture_5.jpeg)

The device developed only for indoor use.

![](_page_13_Picture_7.jpeg)

Check the Jeweller signal level at the installation location

If the signal level is low (one bar), we cannot guarantee the stable operation of the detector. Take all possible measures to improve the quality of the signal. At least, move the detector: even a 20 cm shift can significantly improve the quality of signal reception.

If after moving the device still has a low or unstable signal strength, use a . radio signal range extender

#### **Do not install the detector:**

- **1.** outside the premises (outdoors);
- **2.** nearby sirens and speakers;
- **3.** nearby any metal objects or mirrors causing attenuation or screening of the signal;
- **4.** at any places with fast air circulation (air fans, open windows or doors);
- **5.** inside premises with the temperature and humidity beyond the range of permissible limits;
- **6.** closer than 1 m to the hub.

GlassProtect recognizes glass break at a distance of up to 9 meters. Its microphone should be positioned no more than 90 degrees relative to the window(s).

Make sure that any curtains, plants, furniture, or other objects do not overcover the microphone opening.

If there are curtains on the window, place the detector between them and the window, for instance, at the window side jamb. Otherwise, curtains can mute the glass break sound, and the detector will not be triggered.

### Detector installation procedure

Before installing the detector, make sure that you have selected the optimal location that follows the guidelines of this manual!

- **1.** Fix the SmartBracket attachment panel using bundled screws. If you use any other attachment tools, make sure that they do not damage or deform the attachment panel.
Use double-side adhesive tape only for temporary attachment of the detector. The tape runs dry with time, which can cause falling, false triggering, and detector malfunction.

- **2.** Put the detector on the attachment panel. When the detector is fixed in SmartBracket, it blinks with LED, signaling that the tamper is closed.
If LED doesn't blink after fixing in SmartBracket, check the status of the tamper in the Ajax app and then the fixing tightness of the panel.

If someone detaches the detector from the surface or takes it off the attachment panel, the security system notifies you.

### Connecting a Wired Detector

A wired detector with an NC (normally closed) contact type can be connected to GlassProtect using the in-built terminal clamp.

![](_page_15_Picture_2.jpeg)

We recommend installing the wired detector at a distance no longer than 1 meter to GlassProtect. Longer wire length increases the risk of its damage and reduces the quality of communication between the detectors.

To put out the wire from the detector body, break out the plug:

![](_page_15_Picture_5.jpeg)

If the connected wired detector is triggered, you receive the notification.

#### Maintenance

Check the operational capability of the detector regularly.

Clean the detector body from dust, spider web, and other contaminants as they appear. Use soft dry napkin suitable for tech equipment.

![](_page_16_Picture_3.jpeg)

Do not use any substances containing alcohol, acetone, gasoline, and other active solvents to clean the detector.

The pre-installed battery ensures up to 7 years of autonomous operation (with the 5 minutes ping interval by the hub). If the detector battery is low, the system notifies the user, and the LED indicator smoothly lights up and goes off if a glass break is detected or the tamper is triggered.
