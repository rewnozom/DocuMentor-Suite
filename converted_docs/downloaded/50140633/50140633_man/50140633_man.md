# **1 Introduction**

The VR20M-MFand VR50M-MF are mullion-mount card readers with modern anti-hacking security over OSDP and support for the traditional Wiegand protocol. When installed as part of a secure system over OSDP, the communication from the reader or the controller they are connected to cannot be compromised. The readers are made of hard wearing materials and will endure most weather conditions. The readers are easy to mount and can be mounted on a flat surface. The readers can be cleaned with most kinds of domestic detergents. All readers have a multicolour light frame. The VR50M-MF has a keypad for PIN code.

# **5 Mounting and connecting**

The mullion readers are surface-mounted readers. The readers can be mounted with cables led through the back of the unit or led in from either side through knockout gaps.

For wiring details please refer to:

- l *Connecting the cables* on page 12.
## **5.1 Mounting a reader**

To ensure a close fit, mount the reader on a flat surface.

To attach the base to a surface:

- 1. Make a small hole in the back of the base gasket shown in the diagram below. Use this hole to feed the cable through the gasket and into the reader base.
- 2. Attach the base to the wall with three screws: one in the middle at the top of the base, and one in each of the corners at the bottom of the base.

![](_page_8_Picture_9.jpeg)

| 1 | Location to make a hole for wires |
|---|-----------------------------------|
| 2 | Tamper base                       |
| 3 | Tamper screw                      |

- 3. If tamper protection is required, fix the screw into the hole on the tamper base. Do not over tighten the screw as this can damage the tamper base.
- 4. Continue to follow the instructions detailed in *Connecting the cables* on page 12.

## **5.2 Mounting a reader with cables fed from the side**

If the cables are fed from the side:

- 1. Remove the gasket from the base.
![](_page_9_Picture_5.jpeg)

- 2. Identify which of the knockouts the cables should be fed through.
- 3. Use a pliers to pull the knockout away from the base.

![](_page_9_Picture_8.jpeg)

- 4. Remove the corresponding knockout on the cover.
![](_page_9_Picture_10.jpeg)

- 5. Attach the base to the wall with three screws: one in the middle at the top of the base and one in each of the corners at the bottom of the base.
![](_page_10_Picture_3.jpeg)

| 1 | Tamper base  |
|---|--------------|
| 2 | Tamper screw |

- 6. If tamper protection is required, fix the screw into the hole on the tamper base. Do not over tighten the screw as this can damage the tamper base.
- 7. Feed the cables through the opening and reinsert the gasket. Proceed to the instructions for *Connecting the cables* on the next page.

![](_page_10_Picture_7.jpeg)

Vanderbilt recommend sealing the gap that the knockout creates with a sillicone sealant. Do this after you have closed the reader. Please note that a reader with a removed knockout does not meet the standard for IP 55.

## **5.3 Connecting the cables**

### **5.3.1 Connecting the reader in OSDP mode**

Use the terminal block marked +-BA (see number 2 in *Package contents* on page 8 and a pair of twisted screened cable to connect the cables in OSDP mode.

- 1. Attach the cables according to the respective indicators on the second, +-BA terminal block (lower terminal block) and the base:

| Reader | Controller |
|--------|------------|
| +      | +12V       |
| -      | 0V         |
| B      | B          |
| A      | A          |

- 2. Insert the ridge on the end of the terminal block marked +-BA into the slot marked +,-,B,A.
![](_page_11_Figure_8.jpeg)

- 3. Gently push the terminal block towards the base until it clicks.
- 4. Push the cables back.

Please note that you must set the Jumpers to configure your application. For more information on setting the Jumpers in OSDP mode see *Setting the Jumpers for OSDP* on page 15.

On the reverse of the front plate, Jumper 3 is used to determine EOL (see the diagram in *Connecting the cables* above). By default EOL is ON and the reader acts as the last reader on the bus. However, if the reader is an intermediate reader on the bus, Jumper 3 must be removed.

### **5.3.2 Connecting the reader in Wiegand mode**

Use the terminal blocks marked +-BA and RY/TGH and a pair of twisted screened cables (4 pairs + screen), such as Belden 9502 to connect the reader in Wiegand mode.

- 1. Attach the cables according to the respective indicators on the communication and power terminal block (+-BA terminal block (lower terminal block)):

| Reader | Controller |
|--------|------------|
| +      | +12V       |
| -      | 0V         |
| B      | Wiegand D1 |
| A      | Wiegand D0 |

- 2. Attach the cables on the LED, tamper, and horn terminal block (RY/TGH terminal block (upper terminal block)):

You can use the 3CT tool to configure MIFARE Classic and DESFire EV1 card formats to be configured along with Wiegand options to be used for the card readers. For further information, please contact Vanderbilt International Ltd.. The 3CT tool configures the format in which user cards are interpreted by the card reader. The 3CT tool supports configuration of the following options: Tamper Output / Yellow Input and Heart beat Mode.

| Option          | Default setting | Information                                                                    |
|-----------------|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Yellow input    | Disabled        | Selects Tamper Output when disabled                                            |
| Heart beat mode | Disabled        | Ensures a comms message is sent every 10 seconds to controller<br>when enabled |

For more information on 3CT please see the User manual for Configuration Card Creation Tool which is included when you purchase the 3CT tool.

The readers use FreeRTOS. For further information, please visit www.freetos.org.

## **8.2 Setting burst mode using the keypad**

The default burst mode is 8 bit. This can only be changed to 4 bit if you are using the reader in Wiegand mode. To change from 8 bit to 4 bit burst :

- 1. Set Jumper 2 in the desired Wiegand position as shown in *Connecting the cables* on page 12.
- 2. Ensure Jumper 1 and Jumper 3 are removed.
- 3. Power up the reader while holding the X key. The red and green indicators alternately turn on.
- 4. Press the key sequence 1414 to specify that 4 bit burst is required.
- 5. Hold down the ✓ key until you hear the affirmative beep.
- 6. To change back to 8 bit burst from 4 bit burst, follow the steps above pressing the key sequence 1818 instead of 1414.

# **9 Connecting the reader to SiPass integrated**

## **9.1 Connecting the reader to SiPass integrated in OSDP mode**

![](_page_22_Picture_2.jpeg)

The connection between a reader and a Reader Interface Module (RIM) is as follows:

| RIM (DRI/ERI) |   | VRxx-MF |
|---------------|---|---------|
| 12 V          | ⃡ | +       |
| 0V            | ⃡ | -       |
| Tx/+          | ⃡ | A       |
| Rx/-          | ⃡ | B       |

SiPass integrated can support both the VR and NGCR readers on the same OSDP bus.

## **9.2 Setting OSDP address for the reader**

You can set the reader address to 1 (default setting), 2 , or programmed with a value from 1 to 8 using the Jumper. Place the Jumper in one of the three positions shown in the diagram below to achieve the desired address. Additional addresses are automatically assigned by the controller from 3 to 8 following the order in which the readers are powered up.

![](_page_23_Figure_4.jpeg)

When the reader is first powered up, the yellow LED flashes. The flashing lights stop when it is correctly configured to SiPass integrated. This can be tested by holding a card next to the reader. A correctly configured reader acknowledges the card according to the SiPass integrated settings.

Please note that a new reader will always get the next free bus address. For example, if a reader with bus address 5 is removed and a new reader is installed, the new reader gets address 5.

## **9.3 Connecting the reader to SiPass integrated in Wiegand mode**

For more detail on connecting the reader to SiPass integrated via Wiegand see *Connecting the reader in Wiegand mode* on page 13.

# **10 Connecting the reader to ACT**

| E | Reader 3 (VR40S-MF MIFARE Reader with keypad and display) |

ACTpro 1520e can support both the VR and NGCR readers on the same OSDP bus.

The connection between a reader and an ACTpro 1520e is as follows:

| ACTpro 1520e |   | VRxx-MF |
|--------------|---|---------|
| +12/24 V     | ⃡ | +       |
| OSDP/NET 0V  | ⃡ | -       |
| OSDP/NET A   | ⃡ | A       |
| OSDP/NET B   | ⃡ | B       |

![](_page_25_Picture_2.jpeg)

| 1 | A,B,0V  |
|---|---------|
| 2 | +12/24V |

- 1. Connect the cables as shown in the table on the previous page.
- 2. Use this terminal to supply power to the readers.

## **10.2 Setting the OSDP address for the reader**

The ACTpro 1520e controller automatically assigns an address to each reader. Therefore, Jumper 2 should be removed for OSDP operation. The serial number of the reader is used to identify and enrol a reader on the system . The serial number can be found on a sticker on the reverse of the front cover of the reader (bordered in red in the image below).

![](_page_25_Picture_8.jpeg)

During installation:

- l Record the 7 digit serial number.
- l Record the door name.
- l Record if a reader is an entry or exit reader.

In the OSDP reader section of ACTEnterprise Software input the following attributes:

- l Name
- l Serial number
- l Direction

| Name          | Main door - Entry reader |   |
|---------------|--------------------------|---|
| Serial Number | 5000001                  | ? |
| Direction     | Entry                    |   |
| Description   |                          |   |

## **10.3 Connecting the reader to ACT in Wiegand mode**

For more detail on connecting the reader to ACT via Wiegand see *Connecting the reader in Wiegand mode* on page 13.

If you are connecting an exit reader in Wiegand mode, you should wire the D0 from the reader to SENSE on the ACTpro 1520e (bordered in red on the image below).
