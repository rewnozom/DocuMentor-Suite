## Operating Principle

StreetSiren significantly improves the efficiency of the security system.With a high probability, its loud alarm signal and light indication is sufficient to attract the attention of neighbors and deter intruders.

The siren can be seen and heard from far away due to the powerful buzzer and bright LED. When installed properly, it is hard to dismount and switch off the

actuated siren: its body is sturdy, the metal net protects the buzzer, the power supply is autonomous, and the on/off button is locked during the alarm.

StreetSiren is equipped with a tamper button and an accelerometer. The tamper button is triggered when the device body is opened, and the accelerometer is activated when someone's try to move or dismount the device.

### Connecting

### Before starting the connection:

- **1.** Following the hub user guide, install the . Create an account, add the hub, and create at least one room. Ajax app
- **2.** Switch on the hub and check the internet connection (via Ethernet cable and/or GSM network).
- **3.** Make sure that the hub is disarmed and does not update by checking its status in the Ajax app.

Only users with administrator rights can pair the device with the hub

### **Pairing the device with the hub:**

The on/off button is recessed into the body of the siren and quite tight, you can use a thin solid object to press it.

For detecting and pairing to occur, the device should be located within the coverage of the wireless network of the hub (at the same protected object). The connection request is transmitted briefly: at the moment of switching on the device.

StreetSiren switches off automatically after failing to connect to the hub. To retry the connection, you do not need to switch it off. If the device has already been assigned to another hub, switch it off and follow the standard pairing procedure.

The device connected to the hub appears in the list of devices in the app. The update of the detector statuses in the list depends on the device ping interval set in the hub settings (the default value is 36 seconds).

### Setting up the processing of detector alarms

Through the Ajax app, you can configure which detector alarms can activate the siren. This can help to avoid situations when the security system notifies of LeaksProtect detector alarm or any other device alarm. The parameter is adjusted in the detector or device settings:

- **1.** Sign in to the Ajax app.
- **2.** Go to the **Devices** menu.
- **3.** Select the detector or device.
- **4.** Go to its settings and set the necessary parameters for activating the siren.

### Setting the tamper alarm response

The siren can respond to the tamper alarm of devices and detectors. The option is disabled by default. Note that the tamper reacts to the opening and closing of the body even if the system is not armed!

#### What is a tamper

**For the siren to respond to tamper triggering, in Ajax app:**

- **1.** Go to the **Devices** menu.
- **2.** Select the hub and go to its settings .
- **3.** Select the **Service** menu.
- **4.** Go to **Siren Settings**.
- **5.** Enable the **Alert with a siren if the hub or detector lid is open** option.

## Setting the response to pressing the panic button in the Ajax app

The siren can respond to pressing the panic button in Ajax apps. Note that the panic button can be pressed even if the system is disarmed!

#### **For the siren to respond to pressing the panic button:**

- **1.** Go to the **Devices** menu.
- **2.** Select the hub and go to its settings .
- **3.** Select the **Service** menu.
- **4.** Go to **Siren Settings**.

**5.** Enable the **Alert with a siren if in-app panic button is pressed** option.

### Setting the siren after-alarm indication

![](_page_13_Picture_2.jpeg)

The siren can inform about triggerings in armed system by means of LED indication.

#### **The option functions as follows:**

- **1.** The system registers the alarm.
- **2.** The siren plays an alarm (duration and volume depend on settings).
- **3.** The lower right corner of the siren LED frame blinks twice (about once every 3 seconds) until the system is disarmed.

Thanks to this feature, system users and security companies patrols can understand that the alarm has occurred.

![](_page_13_Picture_9.jpeg)

The siren after-alarm indication does not work for always active detectors, if the detector was triggered when the system was disarmed.

#### **To enable the siren after-alarm indication, in :** Ajax PRO app

- 1. Go to siren settings:
- Hub → Settings → Service → Siren Settings
2. Specify what events the sirens will inform about by double blinking before the security system is disarmed:

- Confirmed alarm
- Unconfirmed alarm
- Lid opening

3. Select the sirens needed. Go back to **Siren Settings**. The set parameters will be saved.

4. Click **Back**. All values will be applied.

StreetSiren with firmware version 3.72 and later supports this function.

### How to set Chime

Chime is a sound signal that indicates the triggering of the opening detectors when the system is disarmed. The feature is used, for example, in stores, to notify employees that someone has entered the building.

Notifications are configured in two stages: setting up sirens and setting up opening detectors.

#### Learn more about Chime

Chime is supported by StreetSiren with firmware version 3.73.1.0 and later.

#### **Siren settings**

- **1.** Go to the **Devices** menu.
- **2.** Select the siren.
- **3.** Go to its settings by clicking the gear icon in the upper right corner.
- **4.** Go to the **Beeps Settings** menu.
- **5.** Scroll down and enable the **Chime on opening** option in the **Beep when disarmed** category.
- **6.** Set the volume of the notifications. 3 options are available:
	- Quiet (88 dB at a distance of 1 m).
	- Loud (94 dB at a distance of 1 m).
	- Very loud (112 dB at a distance of 1 m).

The specified **Beep volume** also applies to the volume of siren notifications when arming/disarming and for the entry/exit delays.

- **7.** Click **Back** to save the settings.
- **8.** Repeat steps 2–7 for other sirens on which you want to enable the notifications.

#### **Detectors settings**

- **1.** Go to the **Devices** menu.
- **2.** Select the detector.
- **3.** Go to its settings by clicking the gear icon in the upper right corner.
- **4.** Go to the **Chime Settings** menu.
- **5.** Select the events to be notified by the siren:
	- If a door or a window is open.
	- If an external contact is open (available if the External Contact option is enabled).
- **6.** Select the chime sound (siren tone): 1 to 4 short beeps. Once selected, the Ajax app will play the sound.
- **7.** Click **Back** to save the settings.
- **8.** Repeat steps 2–7 for other detectors on which you need to enable the notifications.

### Performance Testing

The Ajax security system allows conducting tests for checking the functionality of connected devices.

The tests do not start straight away but within a period of 36 seconds when using the standard settings. The test time start depends on the settings of the detector polling period (the **Jeweller** menu settings in hub settings).

Volume Level Test

Jeweller Signal Strength Test

Attenuation Test

### Installing

The location of the siren depends on its remoteness from the hub, and obstacles hindering the radio signal transmission: walls, floors, large objects.

![](_page_17_Picture_9.jpeg)

Check the Jeweller signal strength at the installation location

If the signal level is low (one bar), we cannot guarantee stable operation of the detector. Take all possible measures to improve the quality of the signal. At least, move the detector: even a 20 cm shift can significantly improve the quality of signal reception.

If the detector has low or unstable signal strength even after moving, use a . radio signal range extender

StreetSiren is protected from dust/moisture (IP54 class), which means it can be placed outdoors. The recommended installation height is 2.5 meters and higher. Such a height hinders access to the device for intruders.

When installing and using the device, follow the general electrical safety rules for electrical appliances, as well as the requirements of regulatory legal acts on electrical safety.

It is strictly prohibited to disassemble the device under voltage! Do not use the device with a damaged power cord.

## Mounting

Before mounting StreetSiren, make sure that you have selected the optimal location and it is in compliance with the guidelines of this manual!

![](_page_18_Picture_5.jpeg)

### Installation process

- **1.** If you are going to use an external power supply (12 V), drill a hole for the wire in SmartBracket. Before installation, make sure that there the wire insulation is not damaged!
You need to drill a hole in the mounting panel to lead out the external power supply wire.

- **2.** Fix SmartBracket to the surface with bundled screws. If using any other attaching hardware, make sure that they do not damage or deform the panel.
![](_page_19_Figure_1.jpeg)

Using the double-sided adhesive tape is not recommended either for a temporary nor permanent fixing.

- **3.** Put StreetSiren on the SmartBracket panel and turn it clockwise. Fix the device with a screw. Fixing the siren to the panel with a screw makes it difficult for intruders to remove the device quickly.
#### **Do not install the siren:**

- **1.** near metal objects and mirrors (they can interfere with the RF signal and cause it to fade);
- **2.** in the places were its sound can be muffled;
- **3.** closer than 1 m from the hub.

### Maintenance

Check the operational capability of StreetSiren regularly. Clean the siren body from dust, spider web, and other contaminants as they appear. Use a soft dry napkin suitable for tech equipment.

Do not use any substances containing alcohol, acetone, gasoline, and other active solvents to clean the detector.

StreetSiren can operate up to 5 years from pre-installed batteries (with the detector ping interval of 1 minute) or approximately 5 hours of constant signaling with buzzer. When the battery is low, the security system notifies the user, and the LED frame corner smoothly lights up and goes out when arming/disarming or when the alarm goes off, including dismounting or unauthorized opening.
