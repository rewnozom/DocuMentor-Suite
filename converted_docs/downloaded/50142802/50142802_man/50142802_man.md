## **Industry Canada ICES-003 Compliance**

This device meets the CAN ICES-3 (B)/NMB-3(B) standards requirements.

This device complies with Industry Canada licence-exempt RSS standard(s). KƉĞƌĂƟŽn is subject to the following two cŽnĚŝƟŽnƐ͗

- 1. this device may not cause interference, and
- 2. this device must accept any interference, including interference that may cause undesired ŽƉĞƌĂƟŽn of the device.

Le présent appareil est conforme aux CNR d'Industrie Canada applicables aux appareils radioexempts de licence. >ΖĞxƉůŽŝƚĂƟŽn est autorisée aux deux cŽnĚŝƟŽnƐ suivantes :

Under Industry Canada ƌĞŐƵůĂƟŽnƐ͕ this radio ƚƌĂnƐmŝƩĞƌ may only operate using an antenna of a type and maximum (or lesser) gain approved for the ƚƌĂnƐmŝƩĞƌ by Industry Canada. To reduce ƉŽƚĞnƟĂů radio interference to other users, the antenna type and its gain should be so chosen that the equivalent isotropically radiated power (e.i.r.p.) is not more than that necessary for successful cŽmmƵnŝcĂƟŽn͘

Conformément à la ƌĠŐůĞmĞnƚĂƟŽn d'Industrie Canada, le présent ĠmĞƩĞƵƌ radio peut ĨŽncƟŽnnĞƌ avec une antenne d'un type et d'un gain maximal (ou inférieur) approuvé pour ůΖĠmĞƩĞƵƌ par Industrie Canada. Dans le but de réduire les risques de brouillage radioélectrique à ůΖŝnƚĞnƟŽn des autres ƵƟůŝƐĂƚĞƵƌƐ͕ il faut choisir le type d'antenne et son gain de sorte que la puissance isotrope rayonnée équivalente (p.i.r.e.) ne dépasse pas l'intensité nécessaire à l'établissement d'une cŽmmƵnŝcĂƟŽn ƐĂƟƐĨĂŝƐĂnƚĞ͘

This equipment should be installed and operated with a minimum distance 20cm between the radiator and your body.

Cet équipement doit être installé et ƵƟůŝƐĠ à une distance minimale de 20 cm entre le radiateur et votre corps.
