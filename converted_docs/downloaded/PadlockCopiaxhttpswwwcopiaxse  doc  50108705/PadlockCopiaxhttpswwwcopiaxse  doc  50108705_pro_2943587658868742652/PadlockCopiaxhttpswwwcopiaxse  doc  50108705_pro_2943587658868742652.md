# SALTO GEO Electronic Cylinder **PADLOCK**

It is a wire free fully stand alone electronic access control solution. It helps users take advantage of electronic access control where previously it was only possible to use a mechanical locking solution. The SALTO GEO Padlock solves traditional padlock masterkey problems and provides users with greater control by enabling them to configure custom access settings on the padlock. 20 13/16" 38 OO1-1/2" 20 13/16" 38 O O1-1/2"
