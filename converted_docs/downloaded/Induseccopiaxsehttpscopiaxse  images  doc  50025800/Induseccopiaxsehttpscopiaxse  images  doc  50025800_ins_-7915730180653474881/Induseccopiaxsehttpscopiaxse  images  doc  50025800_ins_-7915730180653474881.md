- - Do not connect the unit to other supplies than 12 (12-16) V DC.
- - It will not work properly before the unit has been charged for 6 hours.
- The battery must be changed at least every third year.
- - While dealing with the PCB's inside the unit, precautions must be observed for handling electrostatic discharge sensitive devices.
- It´s recommended to use earplugs when installing

CONNECTOR

![](_page_1_Figure_5.jpeg)

GND = Ground BAL = Bad battery signal, see below TRG + = Positive activation TRG - = Negative activation

- 12 V IN = Charge +12 V DC
- V OUT = Reserve
- SAB IN = Tamper out
- SAB OUT = Tamper in

#### Bad battery signal

- Dip switch: 8 ON - Connector: pin 7 and 8 (BAL and GND)

1. Charging Indication ON = A red light will lit when charging. OFF = No indication when charging. (default) 2. Delay between received trigger signal and the alarm sounding. ON = 30 s OFF = 0 s (default) 3. Test Mode ON = Test mode, four short different-pitched sound signals. OFF = Normal mode (default) 4. Alarm Signal Length ON = Infinite alarm OFF = 3 min, after a new trig is needed (default) 5. Reserve 6. Fixed Alarm Signal Length ON = 45 s OFF = Normal mode (default) 7. Sound level ON = 127 ± 1 dB(A) @ 1m. 20 s and then 124 ± 1 dB(A) @ 1m. NOTE! Very high sound level. OFF = 125 ± 1 dB(A) @ 1m (default) 8. Automatic Battery Check ON = Bad battery signal on pin 7 on Connector, see below OFF = Led flash => Bad battery (default) Time to change battery.

### Option: Tamper

The tamper loop is an extra mechanical security protection. It is not needed for the function of the siren. 

The tamper loop consists of a series connection that enters at the Connector at SAB IN goes through the microswitch at the end of the board, runs through the CPU board through the middle connector to the speaker board through the microswitch on that very end and back to the Connector at SAB OUT.

The loop can contain other normally-closed switches such as magnetic contacts or mercury tilt switches in the alarm set-up.

## 4) ASSEMBLING THE UNIT

- 1. Before applying power to the unit, ensure that Dip switch 3 is in the ON position = Test mode.
- 2. Assemble the two PCB's and the battery. Attach the battery cable to the connector.
- 3. Power can now be applied.
- 4. Set Dip switch 1 to ON. A red LED on the CPU circuit board should light up.
- 5. Dip switch 1 can be in either in ON or OFF mode.
- 6. Set the Dip switch 3 to OFF = Normal mode. Attach the grid and the two end caps.
- 7. The Inferno is assembled and ready for use.

## 5) TEST

We recommend testing the unit either before mounting or during assembling.

Without a connected Tamper loop it is only necessary to connect the two PCB's, the battery and power.

Test procedure (The battery will need about 20 minutes to charge before testing.); 1. Set Dip switch 3 to ON position. 

2. Activate either Trigger signal. 

3. The unit should generate four short different-pitched sound signals indicating that the unit works.

- 4. Switch off the Trigger signal.
- 5. Set Dip switch 3 to OFF position. (Normal operation mode)

6. The test is complete.
