#### PADLOCK RETHOUGHT

With the ABUS Touch™ 57, worrying about a lost key or forgetting an opening code are a thing of the past.

Make your life a little easier and secure your bike shed or locker with the ABUS Touch™ 57 weatherproof fingerprint lock. Just touch it and the lock opens. The 360°-capable sensor identifies up to 20 programmed-in fingerprints from any position - no matter how they are placed on it. Registering the fingerprints is super fast. As one of two administrators, simply place your own, already registered finger on the fingerprint sensor for three seconds and "Register mode" is activated. Keeping it there for ten seconds triggers the "Delete mode" setting. Accidentally deleting the prints is therefore virtually impossible. The lock is equipped with a replaceable CR2 battery. And the stored fingerprints are retained even after replacing the battery. With the hardened steel shackle and thanks to the double ball locking, your property is secured in the best possible way with a medium risk of theft. From now on, misplaced keys are a thing of the past.
