# **Warnings**

- Proper configuration of all passwords and other security settings is the responsibility of the installer and/or end-user.
- In the use of the product, you must be in strict compliance with the electrical safety regulations of the nation and region. Please refer to technical specifications for detailed information.
- Input voltage should meet both the SELV (Safety Extra Low Voltage) and the Limited Power Source with 24 VAC or 12 VDC according to the IEC60950-1 standard. Please refer to technical specifications for detailed information.
- Do not connect several devices to one power adapter as adapter overload may cause over-heating or a fire hazard.

- Please make sure that the plug is firmly connected to the power socket. When the product is mounted on wall or ceiling, the device shall be firmly fixed.
- If smoke, odor or noise rise from the device, turn off the power at once and unplug the power cable, and then please contact the service center.

![](_page_10_Picture_3.jpeg)

- Make sure the power supply voltage is correct before using the camera.
- Do not drop the camera or subject it to physical shock.
- Do not touch sensor modules with fingers. If cleaning is necessary, use clean cloth with a bit of ethanol and wipe it gently. If the camera will not be used for an extended period, please replace the lens cap to protect the sensor from dirt.
- Do not aim the camera at the sun or extra bright places. Blooming or smearing may occur otherwise (which is not a malfunction), and affect the endurance of sensor at the same time.
- The sensor may be burned out by a laser beam, so when any laser equipment is in using, make sure that the surface of sensor will not be exposed to the laser beam.
- Do not place the camera in extremely hot, cold (the operating temperature shall be-10°C to +50°C), dusty or damp locations, and do not expose it to high electromagnetic radiation.

- To avoid heat accumulation, good ventilation is required for operating environment.
- Keep the camera away from liquid while in use.
- While in delivery, the camera shall be packed in its original packing, or packing of the same texture.
- Regular part replacement: a few parts (e.g. electrolytic capacitor) of the equipment shall be replaced regularly according to their average enduring time. The average time varies because of differences between operating environment and using history, so regular checking is recommended for all the users. Please contact with your dealer for more details.
- Improper use or replacement of the battery may result in hazard of explosion. Replace with the same or equivalent type only. Dispose of used batteries according to the instructions provided by the battery manufacturer.
- If the product does not work properly, please contact your dealer or the nearest service center. Never attempt to disassemble the camera yourself. (We shall not assume any responsibility for problems caused by unauthorized repair or maintenance.)

#### *Notes:*

- The figures shown in this manual are for reference only. The appearance and interfaces of the camera are subject to the actual model.
- Press RESET about 10s when the camera is powering on or rebooting to restore the default settings, including the user name, password, IP address, port No., etc.

# **2 Installation**

#### *Before you start:*

- Make sure the device in the package is in good condition and all the assembly parts are included.
- The standard power supply is 12V DC or PoE (802.3af), please make sure your power supply matches with your camera.
- Make sure all the related equipment is power-off during the installation.
- Check the specification of the products for the installation environment.
- Make sure that the wall is strong enough to withstand four times the weight of the camera and the bracket.

For the camera that supports IR, you are required to pay attention to the following precautions to prevent IR reflection:

- Dust or grease on the dome cover will cause IR reflection. Please do not remove the dome cover film until the installation is finished. If there is dust or grease on the dome cover, clean the dome cover with clean soft cloth and isopropyl alcohol.
- Make sure that there is no reflective surface too close to the camera lens. The IR light from the camera may reflect back into the lens causing reflection.
- The foam ring around the lens must be seated flush against the inner surface of the bubble to isolate the lens from the IR LEDS. Fasten the dome cover to camera body so that the foam ring and the dome cover are attached seamlessly.

**STRONG PASSWORD RECOMMENDED***– We highly* 

*recommend you create a strong password of your own choosing (using a minimum of 8 characters, including upper case letters, lower case letters, numbers, and special characters) in order to increase the security of your product. And we recommend you reset your password regularly, especially in the high security system, resetting the password monthly or weekly can better protect your product.* 

#### *Note:*

You can enable the Hik-Connect service for the device during activation. Refer to Chapter 5.1 for detailed information.

- 4. Click **Activate** to start activation.
You can check whether the activation is completed on the popup window. If activation failed, make sure that the password meets the requirement and try again.

# **3.3 Modifying the IP Address**

## *Purpose:*

To view and configure the camera via LAN (Local Area Network), you need to connect the network camera in the same subnet with your PC.

Use the SADP software or client software to search and change the IP address of the device. We take modifying the IP Address via SADP software as an example to introduce the IP address modification.

For IP address modification via client software, refer to the user manual of client software.

#### *Steps:*

- 1. Run the SADP software.
- 2. Select an active device.
- 3. Change the device IP address to the same subnet with your computer by either modifying the IP address manually or checking the checkbox of Enable DHCP.
