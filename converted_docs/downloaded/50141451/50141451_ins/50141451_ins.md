## **Chapter 2 Installation and Connections**

## **2.1 NVR Installation**

During installation of the NVR:

- **1.** Use brackets for rack mounting.
- **2.** Ensure ample room for audio and video cables.
- **3.** When routing cables, ensure that the bend radius of the cables are no less than five times than its diameter.
- **4.** Connect the alarm cable.
- **5.** Allow at least 2cm (≈0.75-inch) of space between racks mounted devices.
- **6.** Ensure the NVR is grounded.
- **7.** Environmental temperature should be within the range of -10 to +55º C, +14 to +131º F.
- **8.** Environmental humidity should be within the range of 10% to 90%.

## **2.2 Hard Disk Installation**

### *Before you start:*

Disconnect the power from the NVR before installing a hard disk drive (HDD). A factory recommended HDD

should be used for this installation.

**Tools Required:** Screwdriver.

### **2.2.1 DS-9600NI Series**

### *Purpose:*

The following section introduces the HDD installation for the DS-9600NI-I8 and DS-9600NI-I16 series NVR. Take the example of DS-9616NI-I16 series to describe installation steps.

*Steps:* 

- **1.** Fasten the hard disk mounting handle to the hard disk with screws.

### **2.3 Connections**

### **2.3.1 Alarm Input Wiring**

The alarm input is an open/closed relay. To connect the alarm input to the device, use the following diagram.

![](_page_19_Picture_4.jpeg)

If the alarm input is not an open/close relay, please connect an external relay between the alarm input and the device.

![](_page_19_Figure_6.jpeg)

Figure 2. 10 Alarm Input Wiring

### **2.3.2 Alarm Output Wiring**

To connect to an alarm output (AC or DC load), use the following diagram:

![](_page_19_Figure_10.jpeg)

For DC load, the jumpers can be used within the limit of 12V/1A safely.

To connect an AC load, jumpers should be left open (you must remove the jumper on the motherboard in the NVR). Use an external relay for safety (as shown in the figure above).

There are 4 jumpers (JP6, JP9, JP10, and JP11) on the motherboard, each corresponding with one alarm output. By default, jumpers are connected. To connect an AC load, jumpers should be removed.

#### *Example:*

If you connect an AC load to the alarm output 3 of the NVR, then you must remove the JP 3 jumper.

### **2.3.3 Using Alarm Connectors**

To connect alarm devices to the NVR:

- 1. Disconnect *pluggable block* from the ALARM IN /ALARM OUT terminal block.
- 2. Unfasten stop screws from the *pluggable block*, insert signal cables into slots and fasten stop screws. Ensure signal cables are tight.
- 3. Connect *pluggable block* back into terminal block.

### **2.3.4 Controller Connection**

![](_page_20_Figure_5.jpeg)

Figure 2. 12 Controller Connection

To connect a controller to the NVR:

- 1. Disconnect pluggable block from the KB terminal block.
- 2. Unfasten stop screws from the KB D+, D- *pluggable block*, insert signal cables into slots and fasten stop screws. Ensure signal cables are in tight.
- 3. Connect Ta on controller to D+ on terminal block and Tb on controller to D- on terminal block. Fasten stop screws.
- 4. Connect *pluggable block* back into terminal block.

![](_page_20_Picture_12.jpeg)

Make sure both the controller and NVR are grounded.
