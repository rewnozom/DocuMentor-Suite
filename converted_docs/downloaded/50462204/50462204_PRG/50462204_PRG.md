### *Notes:*

For the camera supports IR, you are required to pay attention to the following precautions to prevent IR reflection:

- Dust or grease on the dome cover will cause IR reflection. Please do not remove the dome cover film until the installation is finished. If there is dust or grease on the dome cover, clean the dome cover with clean soft cloth and isopropyl alcohol.
- Make certain the installation location does not have reflective surfaces of objects too close to the camera. The IR light from the camera may reflect back into the lens causing reflection.
- The foam ring around the lens must be seated flush against the inner surface of the bubble to isolate the lens from the IR LEDS. Fasten the dome cover to camera body so that the foam ring and the dome cover are attached seamlessly.

Modifying the Network Parameters

- 8. Change the device IP address to the same subnet with your computer by either modifying the IP address manually or checking the checkbox of Enable DHCP.
- 9. Input the password to activate your IP address modification.

Security question is used to reset the admin password when admin user forgets the password.

Admin user can follow the pop-up window to complete security question settings during camera activation. Or, admin user can go to **User Management** interface to set up the function.

### *Purpose:*

This section explains how to connect the network camera to the WAN with a static IP or a dynamic IP.

### *Before you start:*

Please apply a static IP from an ISP (Internet Service Provider). With the static IP address, you can connect the network camera via a router or connect it to the WAN directly.

### **Connecting the network camera via a router**

### *Steps:*

- 1. Connect the network camera to the router.
- 2. Assign a LAN IP address, the subnet mask and the gateway. Refer to 2.1.2 Activating the Camera for detailed IP address configuration of the network camera.
- 3. Save the static IP in the router.
- 4. Set port mapping, e.g., 80, 8000, and 554 ports. The steps for port mapping vary according to the different routers. Please call the router manufacturer for assistance with port mapping.

*Note:* Refer to Appendix 2 Port Mapping for detailed information about port mapping.

- 5. Visit the network camera through a web browser or the client software over the internet.

### **Connecting the network camera with static IP directly**

You can also save the static IP in the camera and directly connect it to the internet without using a router. Refer to 2.1.2 Activating the Camera for detailed IP address configuration of the network camera.

![](_page_19_Figure_6.jpeg)

Accessing the Camera with Static IP Directly

### *Before you start:*

Please apply a dynamic IP from an ISP. With the dynamic IP address, you can connect the network camera to a modem or a router.

- **Connecting the network camera via a router**
- 1. Connect the network camera to the router.
- 2. In the camera, assign a LAN IP address, the subnet mask and the gateway. Refer to 2.1.2 Activating the Camera for detailed IP address configuration of the network camera.
- 3. In the router, set the PPPoE user name, password and confirm the password.
- 4. Set port mapping. E.g. 80, 8000, and 554 ports. The steps for port mapping vary

depending on different routers. Please call the router manufacturer for assistance with port mapping.

*Note:* Refer to Appendix 2 Port Mapping for detailed information about port mapping.

- 5. Apply a domain name from a domain name provider.
- 6. Configure the DDNS settings in the setting interface of the router.
- 7. Visit the camera via the applied domain name.

### **Connecting the network camera via a modem**

### *Purpose:*

This camera supports the PPPoE auto dial-up function. The camera gets a public IP address by ADSL dial-up after the camera is connected to a modem. You need to configure the PPPoE parameters of the network camera. Refer to 7.1.3 Configuring PPPoE Settings for detailed configuration.

![](_page_20_Figure_9.jpeg)

Accessing the Camera with Dynamic IP

*Note:* The obtained IP address is dynamically assigned via PPPoE, so the IP address always changes after rebooting the camera. To solve the inconvenience of the dynamic IP, you need to get a domain name from the DDNS provider (E.g. DynDns.com). Please follow the steps below for normal domain name resolution and private domain name resolution to solve the problem.

- Normal Domain Name Resolution
![](_page_20_Figure_13.jpeg)

- *For your privacy and to better protect your system against security risks, we strongly recommend the use of strong passwords for all functions and network*
*devices. The password should be something of your own choosing (using a minimum of 8 characters, including at least three of the following categories: upper case letters, lower case letters, numbers and special characters) in order to increase the security of your product.*

- *Proper configuration of all passwords and other security settings is the responsibility of the installer and/or end-user.*
### *Purpose:*

The setting of the wireless network connection is never easy. To avoid the complex setting of the wireless connection you can enable the WPS function.

WPS (Wi-Fi Protected Setup) refers to the easy configuration of the encrypted connection between the device and the wireless router. The WPS makes it easy to add new devices to an existing network without entering long passphrases. There are two modes of the WPS connection, the PBC mode and the PIN mode.

*Note:* If you enable the WPS function, you do not need to configure the parameters such as the encryption type and you don't need to know the key of the wireless connection.

| PIN Code              | 12345678        | Generate |
|-----------------------|-----------------|----------|
| · PBC connection      | Connect         |          |
| C Use router PIN code | Connect         |          |
| SSID                  | C-WPA2-Personal |          |
| Router PIN code       |                 |          |

Wi-Fi Settings - WPS

PBC refers to the Push-Button-Configuration, in which the user simply has to push a

button, either an actual or virtual one (as the button on the

configuration interface of the IE browser), on both the Access Point (and a registrar of the network) and the new wireless client device.

1. Check the checkbox of to enable WPS.

- 2. Choose the connection mode as PBC.

|  | @ PBC connection | Connect |  |
|--|------------------|---------|--|
|  |                  |         |  |

*Note:* Support of this mode is mandatory for both the Access Points and the connecting devices.

3. Check on the Wi-Fi router to see if there is a WPS button. If yes, push the button and you can see the indicator near the button start flashing, which means the WPS function of the router is enabled. For detailed operation, please see the user guide of the router.

4. Push the WPS button to enable the function on the camera.

If there is not a WPS button on the camera, you can also click the virtual button to enable the PBC function on the web interface.

5. Click **Connect** button.

When the PBC mode is both enabled in the router and the camera, the camera and the wireless network is connected automatically.

### **PIN Mode:**

The PIN mode requires a Personal Identification Number (PIN) to be read from either a sticker or the display on the new wireless device. This PIN must then be entered to connect the network, usually the Access Point of the network.

- 1. Choose a wireless connection on the list and the SSID is loaded automatically.
- 2. Choose **Use route PIN code**.

| WPS                   |                 |          |
|-----------------------|-----------------|----------|
| Enable WPS<br>>       |                 |          |

| PBC connection<br>0   | Connect         |          |
| @ Use router PIN code | Connect         |          |
| SSID                  | C-WPA2-Personal |          |
| Router PIN code       |                 |          |

- 3. Check **Enable Smooth Streaming**.

*Note:* Be sure the **Bitrate Type** is selected as **Constant** and the **SVC** is selected as **OFF** before enable this function. Go to **Configuration > Video/Audio > Video** page to set the parameters.

- 4. Select the mode of smooth streaming. There are three modes selectable: **Auto, Resolution Priority**, and **Error Correction.**
**Auto**: The resolution and bitrate will be adjusted automatically and resolution will take the priority, the upper limits of these two parameters will not exceed the values you set on Video page. Go to **Configuration > Video/Audio > Video** page, set the **Resolution** and **Max. Bitrate** before you enable smooth streaming function. And in this mode, the framerate will be adjusted automatically to max. value.

**Resolution Priority**: The resolution stays the same as the set value in Vid eo page, and the bitrate will be adjusted automatically. Go to **Configurati on > Video/Audio > Video** page, set the **Max. Bitrate** before you enable smooth streaming function. And in this mode the framerate will be adjust ed automatically to max. value.

**Error Correction:** The resolution and bitrate stay the same as the set values in Video page. When the bandwidth is sufficient, there is packet loss or bit error during transmission and these situations will lead to the video data error or loss. This mode is used to correct the data error during transmission. You can configure the error correction proportion within range of 0-100. When the proportion is 0, the data error will be corrected by data retransmission. When the proportion is higher than 0, the error data will be corrected via redundant data that is added to the stream and data retransmission. The higher the value is, the more redundant date will be generated, the more data error will be corrected, and the larger bandwidth is required. When the proportion is 100, the redundant data will be as large as the original data, and the bandwidth is twice required.

*Note:* Be sure the bandwidth is sufficient in Error Correction mode.

Video Settings

### 2. Select the Stream Type.

Supported stream types are listed in the drop-down list.

### *Notes:*

- **•** For some models, the **Third Stream** is not enabled by default. Go to **System > Maintenance > System Service> Software** to enable the function is required.
- **•** The main stream is usually for recording and live view with good bandwidth, and the sub-stream can be used for live view when the bandwidth is limited.
- 3. You can customize the following parameters for the selected stream type.

### **Video Type**:

Select the stream type to video stream, or video & audio composite stream. The audio signal will be recorded only when the **Video Type** is **Video & Audio**.

### **Resolution:**

Select the resolution of the video output.

### **Bitrate Type:**

Select the bitrate type to constant or variable.

### **Video Quality:**

When bitrate type is selected as Variable, 6 levels of video quality are selectable.

### **Frame Rate:**

Set the frame rate. The frame rate is to describe the frequency at which the video stream is updated and it is measured by frames per second (fps). A higher frame rate is advantageous when there is movement in the video stream, as it maintains image quality throughout.

### **Max. Bitrate:**

Set the max. bitrate from 32 to 16384 Kbps. The higher value corresponds to the higher video quality, but the better bandwidth is required.

*Note:* The maximum limit of the max. bitrate value varies according to different camera platforms. For certain cameras, the maximum limit is 8192 Kbps or 12288 Kbps.

### **Video Encoding:**

The camera supports multiple video encodings types, such as H.264, H.265, MJPEG,

and MPEG4. Supported encoding type for different stream types may differ. H.265 is a new encoding technology. Compared with H.264, it reduces the transmission bitrate under the same resolution, frame rate and image quality.

*Note:* Selectable video encoding types may vary according to different camera modes.

### **H.264+ and H.265+:**

- **• H.264+:** If you set the main stream as the stream type, and H.264 as the video encoding, you can see H.264+ available. H.264+ is an improved compression coding technology based on H.264. By enabling H.264+, users can estimate the HDD consumption by its maximum average bitrate. Compared to H.264, H.264+ reduces storage by up to 50% with the same maximum bitrate in most scenes.
- **• H.265+:** If you set the main stream as the stream type, and H.265 as the video encoding, you can see H.265+ available. H.265+ is an improved compression coding technology based on H.265. By enabling H.265+, users can estimate the HDD consumption by its maximum average bitrate. Compared to H.265, H.265+ reduces storage by up to 50% with the same maximum bitrate in most scenes.

You need to reboot the camera if you want to turn on or turn off the H.264+/H.265+. If you switch from H.264+ to H.265+ directly, and vice versa, a reboot is not required by the system.

### *Notes:*

- **•** Upgrade your video player to the latest version if live view or playback does not work properly due to compatibility.
- **•** With H.264+/H.265+ enabled, the parameters such as profile, I frame interval, video quality, and SVC are greyed out.
- **•** With H.264+/H.265+ enabled, some functions are not supported. For those functions, corresponding interfaces will be hidden.
- **•** H.264+/H.265+ can spontaneously adjust the bitrate distribution according the requirements of the actual scene in order to realize the set maximum average

bitrate in the long term. The camera needs at least 24 hours to adapt to a fixed monitoring scene.

Advanced Configuration

### **Detection Parameters:**

**Generation Speed** [1 to 5]: The speed to identify a target. The higher the value, the faster the target will be recognized. Setting the value quite low, and if there was a face in the configured area from the start, this face will not be captured. It can reduce the misinformation of the faces in the wall painting or posters. The default value of 3 is recommended.

**Sensitivity** [1 to 5]**:** The sensitivity to identify a target. The higher the value is, the easier a face will be recognized, and the higher possibility of misinformation would be. The default value of 3 is recommended.

### **Capture Parameters:**

**Face Capture Mode:** Best Shot and Quick Shot are available.

- Best Shot: The best shot after target leave the detection area. Capture Times [1 to 3]: Refers to the capture times a face will be captured during its stay in the configured area.
Capture Interval: [1 to 255 Frame]: The frame interval to capture a picture. If you set the value as 1, which is the default value, it means the camera captures the face in every frame.

Capture Threshold: It stands for the quality of face to trigger capture and alarm. Higher value means better quality should be met to trigger capture and alarm.

- Quick Shot: You can define quick shot threshold and max. capture interval. Quick Shot Threshold: It stands for the quality of face to trigger quick shot. Capture Times: It can be set as limited and unlimited. When it is set as limited, it can be set [0 to 100]. Refers to the capture times a face will be captured during its stay in the configured area.
**Face Exposure**: Check the checkbox to enable the face exposure.

**Reference Brightness** [0 to 100]: The reference brightness of a face in the face exposure mode. If a face is detected, the camera adjusts the face brightness according to the value you set. The higher the value, the brighter the face is.

**Minimum Duration** [1 to 60 minute(s)]: The minimum duration of the camera exposures the face.

*Note:* If the face exposure is enabled, please make sure the WDR function is disabled, and the manual iris is selected.

**Face Filtering Time**: It means the time interval between the camera detecting a face and taking a capture action. If the detected face stays in the scene for less than the set filtering time, capture will not be triggered. For example, if the face filtering time is set as 5 seconds, the camera will capture the detected face when the face keeps staying in the scene for 5 seconds.

*Note:* The face filtering time (longer than 0 s) may increase the possibility of the actual capture times less than the set value above.

**Invalid Capture Filter:** Check the checkbox to enable invalid capture filter. The invalid captured face pictures will be filtered if the function is enabled.

**Restore Default**: Click **Restore** to restore all the settings in advanced configuration to the factory default.

Memory Card Detection

- 2. View the memory card status on **Status Detection** tab.
**Remaining Lifespan:** It shows the percentage of the remaining lifespan. The lifespan of a memory card may be influenced by factors such as its capacity and the bitrate. You need to change the memory card if the remaining lifespan is not enough.

**Health Status:** It shows the condition of your memory card. There are three status descriptions, good, bad, and damaged. You will receive a notification if the health status is anything other than good when the **Arming Schedule** and **Linkage Method** are set.

*Note:* It is recommended that you change the memory card when the health status is not "good".

- 3. Click **R/W Lock** tab to add a lock to the memory card.
With the R/W lock added, the memory card can only be read and write when it is unlocked.

### **Appendix 1 SADP Software Introduction**

### **Description of SADP**

SADP (Search Active Devices Protocol) is a kind of user-friendly and installation-free online device search tool. It searches the active online devices within your subnet and displays the information of the devices. You can also modify the basic network information of the devices using this software.

### **Search active devices online**

### **Search online devices automatically**

After launch the SADP software, it automatically searches the online devices every 15 seconds from the subnet where your computer locates. It displays the total number and information of the searched devices in the Online Devices interface. Device information including the device type, IP address and port number, etc. will be displayed.
