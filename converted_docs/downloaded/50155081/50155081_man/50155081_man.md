# Chapter 3 Initial Configuration

The router can be configured through your web browser that including IE 8.0 or above, Chrome and Firefox, etc. A web browser is included as a standard application in the following operating systems: Linux, Mac OS, Windows 98/NT/2000/XP/Me/Vista/7/8, etc. It provides an easy and user-friendly interface for configuration. There are various ways to connect the router, either through an external repeater/hub or connect directly to your PC. However, make sure that your PC has an Ethernet interface properly installed prior to connecting the router. You must configure your PC to obtain an IP address through a DHCP server or a fixed IP address that must be in the same subnet as the router. If you encounter any problems accessing the router web interface, it is advisable to uninstall your firewall program on your PC, as this tends to cause problems accessing the IP address of the router.

# 3.1 Configure the PC

There are two methods to get IP address for the PC. One is to obtain an IP address automatically from "Local Area Connection", and another is to configure a static IP address manually within the same subnet of the router. Please refer to the steps below.

Here take **Windows 7** as example, and the configuration for windows system is similar.

- 1. Click **Start > Control Panel**, double-click **Network and Internet**, and then double-click **Network Connections.**

# **4.2.2 LAN**

This section allows you to set the related parameters for LAN port. When ETH0 is configured as WAN, the router has four LAN ports, ETH1, ETH2, ETH3, and ETH4. The ETH1, ETH2, ETH3 and ETH4 can freely choose from lan0, lan1, lan2 and lan3. When ETH0 is configured as LAN, the router has five LAN ports, ETH0, ETH1, ETH2, ETH3, and ETH4. The ETH0, ETH1, ETH2, ETH3 and ETH4 can freely choose from lan0, lan1, lan2, lan3 or lan4. Whether it is four LAN ports or five LAN ports, lan0 must be selected by at least one LAN port. The default settings of ETH1/ETH2/ETH3/ETH4 are lan0 and their default IP are 192.168.0.1/255.255.255.0.

# **4.2.8 AI**

This section is used to set the parameters of analog input (AI). AI is a unique interface of R1520 router. The analog input is used to collect analog signals within a certain range, and is often used to collect continuously changing values such as voltage, current, temperature, and pressure of the sensor. The higher the accuracy of the ADC bits used for analog input, the finer the analog quantization and the more accurate the result.

# **4.2.9 Serial Port**

This section allows you to set the serial port parameters. The R1520 router supports two serial ports, COM1 and COM2. It can also be modified according to requirements and configured as two COM1 or two COM2. The serial data can be converted into IP data or through IP data into serial data, and then the data can be transmitted through wired or wireless network, so as to realize the function of transparent data transmission.

# 4.3 Network

# **4.3.1 Route**

This section allows you to set the static route. Static routes are routes based on destination addresses. Up to 20 static routes can be added to the router. Routing Information Protocol, or RIP (Route Information Protocol), is widely used in small networks with stable rate changes. The OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) protocol is used for decision routing within a single autonomous system and is suitable for large networks.

Click Network> Routing> Static Route to enter the static routing table, which allows users to manually add, delete, or modify static routing rules.

# **4.3.2 Firewall**

This section allows you to set the firewall and its related parameters, including Filtering, Port Mapping, Custom Rules, DMZ and Status. Filtering rules allow users to custom accept or discard a specified access source, filtering its IP address or MAC address.

Click "> firewall > filter" to display as follows:

#### **Filtering**

The filtering rules can be used to either accept or block certain users or ports from accessing your router.

#### **DMZ**

The DMZ, also known as the Demilitarized Zone, is being transformed into a large swath of land. It is to solve the problem that the access user of the external network cannot access the internal network server after installing the firewall, and set up a buffer between the non-secure system and the secure system. A DMZ host is an Intranet host that has open access to all ports except the occupied and forwarded ports to the specified address. Click "> firewall > DMZ" to display the following:

If router enables the IP Pass-through, the terminal device (such as PC) will enable the DHCP Client mode and connect to LAN port of the router; and after the router dial up successfully, the PC will automatically obtain the IP address and DNS server address which assigned by ISP. To use this function, the main link needs to be set to WWAN, and the backup link needs to be set to None.

|                    | detects dead IKE peers. When the local end sends an IPsec packet, DPD          |          |  |
|                    | checks the time the last IPsec packet was received from the peer. If the time  |          |  |
|                    | exceeds the DPD interval, it sends a DPD hello to the peer. If the local end   |          |  |
|                    | receives no DPD acknowledgment within the DPD packet retransmission            |          |  |
|                    | interval, it retransmits the DPD hello. If the local end still receives no DPD |          |  |
|                    | acknowledgment after having made the maximum number of                         |          |  |

# **4.4.3 GRE**

This section allows you to set the GRE and the related parameters. Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) is a [tunneling protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunneling_protocol) that can [encapsulate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encapsulation_(networking)) a wide variety of [network layer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_layer) [protocols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protocol_(computing)) inside virtua[l point-to-point links](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point-to-point_(telecommunications)) over an [Internet Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Protocol) network. There are two main uses of GRE protocol: internal protocol encapsulation and private address encapsulation.

# **4.5.6 DDNS**

This section allows you to set the DDNS parameters. DDNS, the full name of dynamic domain name server, is the dynamic domain name service. DDNS service allows you to map a dynamic IP address to a fixed domain name resolution service. Each time a user connects to the network, the client program will transmit the dynamic IP address

of the host to the server program located on the server host. The server program is responsible for providing DNS service and realizing dynamic domain name resolution, that is, DDNS service allows you to provide dynamic w for the host An IP assigns a fixed domain name, and other users can access your host directly through this fixed domain name, rather than through the dynamic Wan IP address. The router's dynamic Wan IP address is assigned directly by the ISP.

# Chapter 5 Configuration Examples

# 5.1 Cellular

# **5.1.1 Cellular Dial-Up**

This section shows you how to configure the primary and backup SIM card for Cellular Dial-up. Connect the router correctly and insert two SIM, then open the configuration page. Under the homepage menu, click **Interface > Link Manager > Link Manager > General Settings**, choose "WWAN1" as the primary link, "WWAN2" as the backup link and "Cold Backup "as the backup mode then click "Submit".

**Note:** In the cold backup mode, when WWAN1 is the primary link, all data will be selected as WWAN1 for transmission, and WWAN2 will always be offline as the backup link; when WWAN1 is disconnected, the data will be switched to WWAN2 for transmission

# **5.1.2 SMS Remote Control**

The router supports remote control via SMS. You can use following commands to get the status of the router, and set all the parameters.

There are three authentication types for SMS control. You can select from "Password", "Phonenum" or "Both".

#### **An SMS command has the following structure:**

- 1. Password mode—**Username:Password;cmd1;cmd2;cmd3;…cmdn** (available for every phone number).
- 2. Phonenum mode-- **Password;cmd1;cmd2;cmd3;… cmdn** (available when the SMS was sent from the phone number which had been added in R1520's phone group).
- 3. Both mode-- **Username:Password;cmd1;cmd2;cmd3;…cmdn** (available when the SMS was sent from the phone number).

**Note:** All command symbols must be entered in the English input half angle mode.

#### **SMS command Explanation:**

- 1. Password: The SMS control password defaults to the login password of the super user or the login password of the ordinary user who has read and write permissions.
- 2. **cmd1,cmd2,cmd3 to cmdn**, the command format is the same as the CLI command, more details about CLI cmd please refer to **Chapter 6 Introductions for CLI**.

**Note:** Download the configure XML file from the configured web browser. The format of SMS control command can refer to the data of the XML file.

Go to **System > Profile > Export Configuration File**, Select export type as "complete", click to generate the XML file and click to export the XML file.

# Chapter 6 Introductions for CLI

# 6.1 What Is CLI

The Command Line Interface (CLI) is a set of software interfaces that provide another way to configure device parameters. Users can connect to the router through SSH or telnet to configure CLI commands. After establishing a Telnet or SSH connection with the router, enter the login account and password (default admin/admin) to enter the router's configuration mode, as shown below.

# 6.4 Quick Start with Configuration ExampleS

The best and quickest way to master CLI is firstly to view all features from the webpage and then read all CLI commands at a time, finally learn to configure it with some reference examples.

## **Example 1: Show current version**

# status system hardware_version = 1.1 firmware_version =3.1.0 firmware_version_full = "3.1.0 (Rev 3199)" kernel_version = 4.9.152 device_model = R1520 serial_number = "" uptime = "0 days, 00:06:51" system_time = "Thu May 14 05:55:52 2020 (NTP not updated)" ram_usage = "74M Free/128M Total"

## **Example 2: Update firmware via tftp**

# tftpupdate (space+?) firmware New firmware # tftpupdate firmware (space+?) String Firmware name # tftpupdate firmware r1520-firmware-3.1.0.ruf host 192.168.100.99 // enter a new firmware name Downloading r1520-firmware-s 100% |*******************************| 5018k 0:00:00 ETA Flashing Checking 100% Decrypting 100% Flashing 100% Verifying 100% Verfify Success upgrade success // update success # config save_and_apply OK // make you configuration effect after reboot

## **Example 3: Set link-manager**

| # set           |          |
|-----------------|----------|
| # set (space+?) |          |
