## **3.2 Wiring Description**

### *Purpose:*

The four-wire indoor station and the four-wire door station are 2 basic but major components in a four-wire video intercom system. As for extended components, the analog camera and the electric bolt can be connected to the indoor station and the door station respectively in a four-wire video intercom system.

Up to 2 door stations are supported simultaneously in the intercom system.

Up to 3 indoor stations are supported simultaneously in the intercom system.

# **4 Installation**

## *Before you start:*

- Make sure the device in the package is in good condition and all the assembly parts are included.
- The power supply the indoor station supports is 12 VDC. Please make sure your power supply matches your indoor station.
- Make sure all the related equipment is power-off during the installation.
- Check the specification of the product for the installation environment.

## **4.1 Indoor Station Installation**

The indoor station supports the wall mounting, including the wall mounting with the junction box, and the wall mounting without the junction box.

For the wall mounting with junction box, the wall mounting plate and the junction box are required. And for the wall mounting without junction box, only the wall mounting plate is required.

(Optional) The dimension of the junction box is 75 mm (width) x 75 mm (length) x 50 mm (depth).

The dimension of the wall mounting plate is shown in Figure 4-1.

## **Wall Mounting Plate (Indoor Station)**

Figure 4-1 Wall Mounting Plate

## **Wall Mounting (Indoor Station)**

You can follow the following steps to install the indoor station.

Here we take the wall mounting with the junction box as example.

## *Steps:*

- 1. Insert the junction box to the hole chiseled on the wall.
- 2. Fix the wall mounting plate to the junction box with 2 screws.

## **NOTE**

For the installation without the junction box, you should fix the wall mounting plate to the wall with 2 expansion screws first, and then hook the indoor station.

## **4.2 Door Station Installation**

### **Accessoris (Door Station)**

To install the door station, the wall mounting shield and the wall mounting plate are required.

## **Wall Mounting (Door Station)**

You can follow the following steps to install the door station. *Steps:* 

![](_page_16_Figure_3.jpeg)

Figure 4-4 Install the Door Station

- 1. Fix the wall mounting plate to the wall with 2 screws.
- 2. Hook the door station to the shield tightly by inserting the hooks of shield panel into the slots on the rear panel of the door station.
- 3. Secure the door station with the mounting shield with the set screw.
- 4. Use 3 screws to secure the wall mounting shield with the door station.

## **NOTE**

- The maximum live view duration is 60s; and the maximum speaking duration is 60s.
- During the ring duration, speaking duration, or live view duration, the resident can unlock the door. The unlocking status can maintain 5 seconds after pressing the Unlock key.
- To achieve the optimal pickup effect, the recommended distance range between the speaker and the microphone of the indoor station or the door station is 30 to 40 cm.

# **Appendix**

## **Installation Notice**

While installing the indoor station, make sure that the distance between any two devices is far enough to avoid the howling and echo. The distance between two devices is recommended to be longer than 10 meters.

## **NOTE**

Here devices refer to indoor stations, and door stations.
