You may choose to route the main power supply through an intermediate power supply box (VG4-PSU1 or VG4-PSU2) before connecting the power to the pendant arm power supply box (VG4-PA0).

![](_page_18_Picture_5.jpeg)

#### **Caution!**

Select a rigid mounting location to prevent excessive vibration to the camera.

- 2. Use only UL-listed liquid tight strain reliefs for conduits to the Power Supply Box to ensure that water cannot enter the box. You must use water tight conduits and fittings to meet NEMA 4 standards.
- 3. Purchase the appropriate mounting hardware to use, depending on the location of the camera, either wall mount, corner mount, or mast (pole) mount. If your application contains a Power Supply Box, refer to *Mount Power Supply Box (Wall, Mast (Pole), and Corner Mounts), page 25*.

If you are using the Mounting Plate with a 24 V AUTODOME camera, refer to *Installing the VGA-PEND-WPLATE, page 36*.

![](_page_18_Picture_11.jpeg)

For units intended to be installed outdoors: All wiring (power and I/O cabling) connecting to the unit must be routed separately inside different permanently earthed metal conduits (not supplied).

![](_page_18_Picture_13.jpeg)

**!**

### **Warning!**

To minimize the potential for corrosion on the housing, use only Bosch hardware and mounts. See number 5 (Installation in a corrosive environment) in the section Recommended Use of Your Camera for more information.

- 4. Install all external wiring including power, control, video coax, alarms I/O, relay I/O, and fiber optic cabling. Refer to the *Connection, page 56* chapter for required cable types and allowed lengths.
### **Warning!**

![](_page_18_Picture_18.jpeg)

Install external interconnecting cables in accordance to NEC, ANSI/NFPA70 (for US application) and Canadian Electrical Code, Part I, CSA C22.1 (for CAN application) and in accordance to local country codes for all other countries.

Branch circuit protection incorporating a 20 A, 2-pole Listed Circuit Breaker or Branch Rated Fuses are required as part of the building installation. A readily accessible 2-pole disconnect device with a contact separation of at least 3 mm must be incorporated. 24 VAC Class 2 power supply only.

- 5. If you plan to use the Intelligent Tracking feature, refer to *Configuring and Implementing Intelligent Tracking, page 20* before mounting the camera.
# **4.1 Stabilization**

Surveillance cameras are susceptible to vibrations caused by wind or vibrations emanating from the medium to which the camera is attached. Cameras attached to a pole, roof, or to a bridge are especially vulnerable. Bosch offers the following recommendations to stabilize an AUTODOME camera and to decrease the affects of vibration on transmitted images, privacy masks, and Intelligent Tracking.

#### **Pole and Mast Mounts**

- Use a pendant arm with the Pole Mount Adapter (VG4-A-9541).
	- Do not attach a parapet mount to a pole or mast.
- Use a pole designed specifically for CCTV cameras:
	- Do not use a tapered pole.
	- Do not use a pole that has signs or other equipment attached.
- Consult EPA rating / Wind load data to select an appropriate pole.

#### **Roof Mounts**

- Mount the camera in the most stable location on the roof.
- Avoid locations affected by vibrations such as those caused by a rooftop air conditioner.
- Use guy wires to stabilize the AUTODOME against strong winds.
- Use the LTC 9230/01 Flat Roof Mount Adapter where appropriate. This adapter is made specifically for AUTODOME roof applications.

#### **Extreme Mount Applications**

Unique camera mounting applications that are impacted by extreme high winds, heavy traffic, or other conditions may require additional measures to stabilize the camera. Contact a manufacturer that specializes in passive vibration suppression using either damping or isolation.

# **4.2 Configuring and Implementing Intelligent Tracking**

#### **Configuring Intelligent Tracking**

The camera utilizes the built-in Intelligent Video Analytics (IVA) to continuously follow an individual or object even if it passes behind a Privacy Mask or a stationary object. The camera uses objects detected by IVA in a stationary preset position to activate the Intelligent Tracking feature.

The Intelligent Tracking feature allows continuous on-screen following of an individual or an object. This feature operates by recognizing an object in motion and zooms in to approximately 50% (default Tracker zoom threshold) of the field of view for an average target height of six feet. This feature controls the pan/tilt/zoom actions of the camera to keep the selected object in the scene.

![](_page_20_Figure_2.jpeg)

#### **Guidelines for Implementing Intelligent Tracking**

Factors such as the viewing angle and unwanted motion (from trees, for example) may interfere with Intelligent Tracking operation. Use the following recommendations to ensure smooth Intelligent Tracking operation:

#### – **Mount/Mounting Surface Stability**

- Mount the camera in the most stable position. Avoid locations affected by vibrations, such as those caused by a roof-top air conditioner. These vibrations may cause complications when the camera zooms-in on a target.
- Use the pendant arm mount, if possible. This mount option provides the most stability for the camera.
- Use guy wires to protect against strong winds if using the parapet mount.

#### – **Field of View**

- Select a location and viewing angle that allows the flow of people to move across the camera's field of view.
- Avoid motion that moves directly towards the camera.
- Avoid locations that attract large numbers of people, such as retail stores or intersections. Intelligent Tracking is optimized for scenes with very few moving objects.
- **Unwanted Motion**
	- Avoid neon lights, flashing lights, night time lights, and reflected light (from a window or mirror, for example). The flickering of these lights can affect the Intelligent Tracking operation.
	- Avoid motion from moving leaves/branches that present a persistent fixed motion.

# **5 Preparing the bubble**

#### **Notice!**

To avoid excessive moisture saturation inside the housing, limit the amount of time that the bubble is disconnected from the housing. Bosch recommends that the bubble be removed from the housing for no more than five (5) minutes.

#### **Remove the bubble from a pendant housing**

- 1. Using both hands, apply a firm counterclockwise (looking up at the dome) rotational force on the pendant bubble assembly to set the bubble latch.
- 2. Insert a small (2 mm) straight blade screw driver into the release opening in the bubble trim-ring to release the lock, and then remove the screwdriver.

![](_page_21_Picture_9.jpeg)

#### **Figure 5.1: Remove the bubble**

- 4 Firmly rotate the bubble counterclockwise approximately 20 degrees until the bubble assembly releases from the pendant housing.
# **6 (Optional) Installing an SD Card**

The camera can accept a customer-supplied **SDHC** or **SDXC** memory card (hereafter referred to as "SD card") for local storage. (The camera will not accept MicroSD cards.) Using an **SD** card is optional.

**Note:** Disconnect power to the camera while adding or removing an **SD** card.

- 1. Follow the steps in one of these sections (depending on the type of camera mount): Remove bubble from in-ceiling housing or Remove bubble from pendant housing.
- 2. Locate the SD card slot (highlighted in the figure below).

![](_page_22_Picture_8.jpeg)

- 3. Orient the card so that the side with the golden contacts faces away from the dome and towards the housing. The contacts should be at the bottom as you hold the SD card.
- 4. Slide the SD card into the slot. Press down the end of the SD cards until you hear a click and the card locks into place.
- 5. Follow the steps in one of these sections (depending on the type of camera mount): Replace the bubble in an in-ceiling housing or Replace the bubble in a pendant housing.

# **7 Replacing the trim ring and bubble**

#### **Replace the bubble in a pendant housing**

- 1. Insert the bubble and trim ring assembly into the pendant housing.
- 2. Rotate the assembly clockwise until it locks. The latch mechanism makes a click when it locks.

# **8 Mount Power Supply Box (Wall, Mast (Pole), and Corner Mounts)**

Before mounting the Power Supply Box, decide if you should wire the box through the holes in the bottom or back of the box. If wiring the box through the back, move the two (2) seal plugs to the bottom through the holes before mounting.

![](_page_24_Picture_5.jpeg)

#### **Notice!**

Use 3/4-inch (20-mm) NPS fittings for the holes on the bottom and back of the box. Use 1/2 inch (15-mm) NPS fittings for the side holes.

![](_page_24_Picture_8.jpeg)

**Figure 8.1: Power Supply Wall, Mast (Pole), and Corner Mounts**

- 1. Use the wall mount template supplied in the packaging box to locate the four (4) mounting holes for the Power Supply Box.

## **13.3 Ethernet Connections**

The camera connects to a 10 Base-T/100 Base-TX network either directly or via a hub. Video, optional audio input, optional audio output, and control are transmitted over a standard TCP/ IP network using the built-in Web server. In addition, power can be supplied over the Ethernet cable using the Bosch High PoE 60W midspan (sold separately). Power can also be supplied over the Ethernet cable to in-ceiling models and indoor/outdoor pendant models used in indoor applications (where the heater is not powered) using PoE+ PSEs (midspan switches) compliant with the IEEE 802.3at, class 4 standard.

The camera can be connected simultaneously to a 24 VAC power supply and to a High PoE 60 W midspan. The camera uses power from the 24 VAC power supply. If this power supply fails, the camera seamlessly switches power input to the High PoE 60 W midspan. The camera switches back to the 24 VAC power supply once power is restored.

Refer to Using the IP Interface, for instructions on configuring an IP environment.

#### **Warning!**

![](_page_56_Picture_11.jpeg)

**BOSCH High PoE or PoE+ (802.3at)**: Use only approved High PoE or PoE+ (802.3at) devices. For outdoor pendant applications that require heater power use only the Bosch High PoE midspan (sold separately) to power the camera and the heaters. For in-ceiling or indoor pendant applications that don't require heater power, standard PoE+ (802.3at) midspans or switches can be used to power the camera.

When powering the camera via PoE or a midspan device, additional surge protection is required.

If auxiliary power (24VAC camera and 24VAC heater) and High PoE are applied simultaneously, the camera selects the auxiliary 24VAC input and draws minimal power from the High PoE midspan.

![](_page_56_Picture_15.jpeg)

#### **Caution!**

Ethernet CAT 5E/CAT 6 cables must be routed through earth-grounded conduit for indoor or outdoor applications. For outdoor applications, the conduit should be capable of withstanding the outdoor environment.

# **13.5 Alarms and Relay Connections**

#### **Alarm Inputs**

The camera provides seven alarm inputs. Each input can be activated by dry contact devices such as pressure pads, passive infra-red detectors, door contacts, and similar devices. The table below summarizes the size and distance wires.

| Wire Size |       | Maximum Distance |        |
|-----------|-------|------------------|--------|
| AWG       | mm    | feet             | meters |
| 22        | 0.644 | 500              | 152.4  |
| 18        | 1.024 | 800              | 243.8  |

**Tab. 13.3:** Alarm wire guide

You wire alarms either Normally Open (N.O.) or Normally Closed (N.C.), and must program the alarm inputs N.O. (the default) or N.C. through the page **Configuration**. The camera incorporates two types of alarms: Non-supervised and Supervised. In addition to transmitting an alarm condition, a supervised alarm also transmits a tamper condition.

Depending on how the alarm is configured, a short or a break in the alarm's circuit can trigger the tamper signal.

#### **Configuring Supervised Alarms (inputs 1 and 2)**

To configure Alarm 1 or 2 (pin 5 or 6) for supervision, you must install a 2.2 K end-of-line resistor in the circuit. Then, you program the alarms, through **Configuration**, to either Normally Open (N.O.) or Normally Closed (N.C.).

![](_page_58_Picture_11.jpeg)

#### **Notice!**

Only Alarms 1 and 2 (pins 5 or 6) can be configured for supervision. Once a supervised alarm is programmed, it does not need to be enabled to indicate a tamper condition.

#### **Configuring a Normally Open Supervised Alarm**

- 1. Install a 2.2 K end-of-line resistor in the alarm circuit.
- 2. Connect the alarm wires to input 1 or 2 (pin 5 or 6) and to the ground (pin 7) at the camera.

#### **Alarm Outputs**

The camera incorporates two (2) types of alarm outputs: one dry contact relay and three (3) open collector outputs or transistor outputs.

#### **Configuring a Dry Contact Relay**

The dry contact relay acts like an on/off switch. It has a maximum voltage rating of 2 A @ 30 DC.

- 1. Connect the appropriate stripped wire to the camera's COM connector.
- 2. Connect the appropriate stripped wire to the N.O. or N.C. connector, depending on your requirement.

#### **Configuring an Open Collector Output**

Outputs 1, 2, and 3 are open collector types. These outputs must be connected to a positive voltage between 5 and 32 V to complete the circuit, with a maximum voltage rating of 32 VDC @ 150 ma.

- 1. Connect the appropriate stripped wire to the open connector (1, 2, or 3) of the transistor.
- 2. Connect the appropriate stripped wire to the ground (GND) connector.

# **13.6 Audio Connections (Optional)**

The camera is capable of receiving line level input signals and transmitting them over a network. It is also capable of receiving audio from the same network and sending it as audio output from the camera. The audio input signal is transmitted in sync with the video signals. As a result, for example, a door intercom system can be connected at the camera location.

![](_page_61_Picture_4.jpeg)

#### **Notice!**

The line ports of the intercom should be used for transmitting audio signals on the intercom systems.

The audio line input is not suitable for direct microphone signal connection.

The audio line output is not suitable for direct speaker connection unless using a powered/ amplified speaker with line level input.

# **15 Maintenance**

All bubbles require special care when handling and cleaning to avoid scratches.

![](_page_67_Picture_4.jpeg)

#### **Notice!**

To avoid excessive moisture saturation inside the housing, limit the amount of time that the bubble is disconnected from the housing. Bosch recommends that the bubble be removed from the housing for no more than five (5) minutes.

#### **Bubble Handling**

The bubble may be packaged with a protective plastic sheet. It is recommended that the bubble remain stored this way until it is ready to install. Limit handling the bubble, as any scratches can quickly affect visibility.

#### **Bubble Cleaning**

If cleaning the bubble is required, use the following procedures and comply with all the warnings listed below.

#### **Cleaning the Bubble Interior**

The extremely soft interior surface should not be cleaned by rubbing or dusting with a cloth. Use clean dry compressed air, preferably from a spray can, to remove any dust from the interior surface.

![](_page_67_Picture_13.jpeg)

#### **Warning!**

Do not use alcohol-based solutions to clean the polycarbonate bubble. This will cause the polycarbonate to cloud and over time cause stress aging, which makes the bubble brittle.

#### **Cleaning the Bubble Exterior**

The exterior of the polycarbonate bubble is hard coated for extra protection. If cleaning becomes necessary, only use cleaning solutions and cloths suitable for cleaning safety glass lenses. Dry the bubble thoroughly with a dry nonabrasive cloth to prevent water spots. Never scrub the bubble with any abrasive material or cleaners.

Bosch recommends cleaning the exterior of the bubble with NOVUS "No. 1" Plastic Clean & Shine (or equivalent), according to manufacturer's instructions. Refer to [www.novuspolish.com](http://www.novispolish.com) to order or to find a local distributor.

#### **Cautions**

- Do Not clean bubbles in the hot sun or on very hot days.
- Do Not use abrasive or highly alkaline cleaners on the bubble.
- Do Not scrape the bubble with razor blades or other sharp instruments.
- Do Not use Benzene, Gasoline, Acetone, or Carbon Tetrachloride on the bubble.
