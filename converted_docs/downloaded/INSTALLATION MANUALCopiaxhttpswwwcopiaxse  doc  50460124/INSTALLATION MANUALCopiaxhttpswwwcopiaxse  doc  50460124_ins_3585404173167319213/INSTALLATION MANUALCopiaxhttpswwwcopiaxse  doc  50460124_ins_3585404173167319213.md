- Reorient or relocate the receiving antenna.
- Increase the separation between the equipment and receiver.
- Connect the equipment into an outlet on a circuit different from that to which the receiver is connected.
- Consult the dealer or an experienced radio/ TV technician for help.

This device complies with FCC RF radiation exposure limits set forth for an uncontrolled environment. Must not be co-located or operating in conjunction with any other antenna or transmitter.

This device complies with part 15 of the FCC Rules. Operation is subject to the following two conditions:

- 1. This device may not cause harmful interference, and
- 2. this device must accept any interference

## **FCC/IC SAR statement**

**English**

This equipment has been tested and meets applicable limits for radio frequency (RF) exposure.

Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) refers to the rate at which the body absorbs RF energy. The SAR limit is 1.6 watts per kilogram in countries that set the limit averaged over 1 gram of tissue. During testing, device radios are set to their highest transmission levels and placed in positions that simulate use near the body, with 0 mm separation.

Cases with metal parts may change the RF performance of the device, including its compliance with RF exposure guidelines, in a manner that has not been tested or certified.

#### **Français**

Cet équipement a été testé et respecte les limites applicables d'exposition aux radiofréquences (RF).

Le débit d'absorption spécifique est la vitesse à laquelle le corps absorbe l'énergie radiofréquence. La limite du débit d'absorption spécifique est de 1,6 watt par kilogramme dans les pays où la moyenne a été établie sur un gramme de tissu. Pendant l'essai, les radios de appareil sont réglées sur le niveau de transmission maximal et sont placées dans des positions simulant une utilisation à proximité du corps, avec une séparation de 0 mm.

Les étuis dotés de pièces métalliques peuvent modifier les performances des radiofréquences de l'appareil, y compris sa conformité aux directives d'exposition aux radiofréquences, d'une façon qui n'a pas été testée ou certifiée.
