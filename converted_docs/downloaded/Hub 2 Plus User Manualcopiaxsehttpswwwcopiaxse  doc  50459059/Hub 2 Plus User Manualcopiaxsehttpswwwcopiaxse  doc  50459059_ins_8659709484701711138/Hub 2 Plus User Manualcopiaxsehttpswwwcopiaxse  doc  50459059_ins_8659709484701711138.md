# Operating principle

The hub monitors the security system operation by communicating with connected devices via the . The communication range is up to 2000 m without obstacles (for example, walls, doors, inter-floor constructions). If the detector is triggered, the system raises the alarm in 0.15 seconds, activates the sirens, and notifies the central monitoring station of the security organization and the users. Jeweller encrypted protocol

If there is interference at the operating frequencies or when jamming is attempted, Ajax switches to a free radio frequency and sends notifications to the central monitoring station of the security organization and to system users.

# What jamming of a wireless security system is and how to resist it

Hub 2 Plus supports up to 200 Ajax devices connected, which protect against intrusion, fire, and flooding, as well as control electrical appliances automatically according to scenarios or manually from an app.

To send photos from / motion detector, a separate Wings radio protocol and a dedicated antenna are used. This ensures the delivery of visual alarm verification even with an unstable signal level and interruptions in communication. MotionCam MotionCam Outdoor

**Geofence** — configuring reminders for arming/disarming the security system when crossing a specified area. The user location is determined using the smartphone GPS module.

#### What geofences are and how they function

**Groups** — group mode configuration. This allows you to:

- Manage the security modes for separate premises or groups of detectors. For example, the office is armed while the cleaner works in the kitchen.
- Delimit access to control of security modes. For example, the marketing department employees do not have access to the law office.

How to enable and configure group mode in the Ajax security system

**Security Schedule** — arming/disarming the security system by the schedule.

How to create and configure a scenario in the Ajax security system

**Detection Zone Test** — running the detection zone test for the connected detectors. The test determines the sufficient distance for the detectors to register alarms.

What is Detection Zone Test

**Jeweller** — configuring the hub-detector ping interval. The settings determine how frequently the hub communicates with devices and how quickly the loss of connection is detected.

### Learn more

- **Detector Ping Interval** the frequency of connected devices polling by the hub is setting in the range of 12 to 300 s (36 s by default)
- **Number of undelivered packets to determine connection failure** a counter of undelivered packets (8 packets by default).

**The time before raising the alarm by the communication loss between hub and device is calculated with the following formula:**

Ping interval * (number of undelivered packets + 1 correction packet).

The shorter ping interval (in seconds) means faster delivery of the events between the hub and the connected devices; however, a short ping interval reduces the battery life. At the same time, alarms are transmitted immediately regardless of the ping interval.

**We do not recommend reducing the default settings of the ping period and interval.**

Note that the interval limits the maximum number of connected devices:

| Interval | Connection limit |
|----------|------------------|
| 12 s     | 39 devices       |

| 24 s | 79 devices  |
|------|-------------|
| 36 s | 119 devices |
| 48 s | 159 devices |
| 72 s | 200 devices |

### Server Connection

The menu contains settings for communication between the hub and the Ajax Cloud:

- **Hub-Server Polling Interval, sec.** Frequency of sending pings from the hub to Ajax Cloud server. It is set in the range of 10 to 300 s. The recommended default value is 60 s.
- **Deley of Server Connection Failure Alarm, sec.** It is a delay to reduce the risk of a false alarm associated with the Ajax Cloud server connection loss. It is activated after 3 unsuccessful hub-server polls. The delay is set in the range of 30 to 600 s. The recommended default value is 300 s.

The time to generate a message regarding the loss of communication between the hub and the Ajax Cloud server is calculated using the following formula:

> (Ping interval * 4) + Time filter

With the default settings, Ajax Cloud reports the hub loss in 9 minutes:

$$(60\text{ s}^{\star}\text{ 4}) + 300\text{ s} = 9\text{ min}^{\star}$$

- **Receive events of server connection loss without alarm**. Ajax apps can notify about the hub-server communication loss in two ways: with a standard push notification signal or with a siren sound (enabled by
default). When the option is active, the notification comes with a standard push notification signal.

- **Notify of connection loss over channels**. Ajax security system can notify both the users and the security company about the loss of connection even via one of the connection channels.
In this menu, you can choose the connection loss of which channels will be reported by the system, as well as the delay for sending such notifications:

- Ethernet
- Cellular
- Wi-Fi
- **Loss Notification Delay, min** time of the delay before sending the notification about loss of connection via one of the communication channels. Set in the range from 3 to 30 minutes.

The time of sending a notification about the loss of connection via one of the communication channels is calculated with the formula:

> (Polling interval * 4) + Time filter + Loss Notification delay

# Sirens settings

The menu contains two groups of siren settings: siren activation parameters and siren after-alarm indication.

# Siren activation parameters

**If the hub or detector lid is open**. If enabled, the hub activates the connected if the body of the hub, detector, or any other Ajax device is open. sirens

How to add a camera to the Ajax security system

# Connecting to a security company

The list of companies that accept the system to the central monitoring station is in the **Security companies** menu (**Devices** → **Hub → Settings** → **Security companies**):

![](_page_29_Picture_1.jpeg)

Select a security company and click **Send Monitoring Request**. After that, the security company will contact you and discuss the connection conditions. Or you can contact them yourself (contacts are available in the app) to agree upon a connection.

Connection to the Central Monitoring Station (CMS) is implemented via the Contact ID or SIA protocol.

# Installation

Prior to installing the hub, make sure that you have selected the optimal location and that it complies with the requirements of this manual! It is desirable that the hub be hidden from direct view.

Make sure that the communication between the hub and all connected devices is stable. If the signal strength is low (a single bar), we cannot guarantee a stable operation of the security system. Implement all potential measures to improve the signal quality! At the very least, relocate the hub as even repositioning by 20 cm can significantly improve the signal reception.

If the device has a low or unstable signal strength, use a . radio signal range extender

When installing and using the device, follow the general electrical safety regulations for using electrical appliances, as well as the requirements of regulatory legal acts on electrical safety. It is strictly forbidden to disassemble the device under voltage! Do not use the device with a damaged power cable.

# **Hub installation:**

- **1.** Fix the SmartBracket mounting panel with bundled screws. When using other fasteners, make sure they do not damage or deform the panel.
![](_page_30_Picture_3.jpeg)

We do not recommend using double-sided adhesive tape for installation: it can cause a hub to fall in case of an impact.

- **2.** Attach the hub to the mounting panel. After installation, check the tamper status in the Ajax app and then the quality of the panel fixation. You will receive a notification if an attempt is made to tear the hub off the surface or remove it from the mounting panel.
- **3.** Fix the hub on the SmartBracket panel with bundled screws.

![](_page_30_Picture_7.jpeg)

Do not flip the hub when attaching vertically (for example, on a wall). When properly fixed, the Ajax logo can be read horizontally.

![](_page_30_Picture_9.jpeg)

**Do not place the hub:**

- Outside the premises (outdoors).
- Nearby or inside any metal objects or mirrors causing attenuation and screening of the signal.
- In places with high radio interference level.
- Close to radio interference sources: less than 1 meter from the router and power cables.
- Inside any premises with the temperature and humidity beyond the range of permissible limits.

# Maintenance

Check the operational capability of the Ajax security system on a regular basis. Clean the hub body from dust, spider webs and other contaminants as they appear. Use soft dry napkin suitable for equipment maintenance.

Do not use any substances containing alcohol, acetone, gasoline and other active solvents for cleaning the hub.
