# **4 Warnings**

- 
The receiver allocation is very important for the best operation of the system. Place the receiver far from interference sources such as big magnetic fields or radio emissions.The distance between 2 receivers must be at least 1,5 m.

- The equipment must be powered from a device that provides a safety extra low voltage (SELV) type LPS ( Low Power Source);

- There must be a suitable disconnecting device to the current drawn by the receiver (90 mA max @ 12Vdc).

# **7 The App "RxCube"**

The setup of the receiver can be done only through the App "RxCube". Once downloaded, authorize the App to use the Bluetooth communication. The App will ask even the GPS localization: please authorize it for the full operating of the Bluetooth BLE.

**Warning:** the upload of the backup will overwrite the actual memory of the receiver.

## **RX CUBE POWER**

## **8 The App "UserCube"**

App for final Users. It allows the activation ot the receiver relay from the smartphone. UserCube transforms the user's smartphone in a Bluetooth remote control, with its own Serial Number (called UserCode) and an ID (UserName).

![](_page_5_Figure_3.jpeg)

The User sends his own UserCode to the installer. The Installer memorizes and enables it (consuming a mobile credential). The User, than, has just to connect to the receiver, the app will do the rest. If the Smartphone is memorized and correctly enabled, it will be created a button. The User can personalize it changing the icon or the name.

# **9 Mobile Credentials Cards**

Mobile Credentials are the virtual token that installer uses to enable smartphones. They can be acquired by NFC Card directly with the app RxCube
