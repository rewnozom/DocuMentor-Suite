# **INSTALLATION**

![](_page_6_Picture_6.jpeg)

To install the SALTO Neo cylinder: following the instructions attached with the product, or visiting our website:

**www.saltosystems.com/en/quick-links/manuals-and-guides/**

#### **PROGRAMMING**

To grant or deny access permissions are used to the right SW license. Once you update the system configuration:

- **RW SYSTEM**: the system allows electronic cylinders to read, receive and write information via its operating smart cards or "intelligent keys". This data is captured from the cards at SVN on-line hot spots located at strategic points around the building. The "online points" uploads and downloads user related information that is then used to permit, control or deny access.
- **KS SYSTEM**: the system allows electronic cylinders to read, receive and write information via radio SALTO KS.

## **BATTERIES**

In the case of complete battery failure the product both safe and secure, i.e. the outside handle fails "locked" to avoid intrusions, the inside handle fails "open" to permit emergency openings.

*WARNING: electronic cylinder in standalone or offline mode needs to be update with the PPD to recover the hour. "The product should not be modified in any way except in accordance with those modifications described in the instructions".*

**SALTO just warrantee the correct and best autonomy with Alkaline LR1 Energivm – batteries (SP01926-5).**
