**StreetSiren DoubleDeck** is a wireless outdoor siren with mount for the branded faceplate. Equipped with a LED frame and piezoelectric alarm indicator producing sound volume up to 113 dB, StreetSiren can operate up to 5 years from pre-installed batteries. It can also be powered from an external 12 V power supply.

StreetSiren DoubleDeck communicates with the hub via the secured Jeweller radio protocol. The communication range is up to 1,500 meters provided there are no obstacles.

The siren only works as part of the Ajax security system. Integration with third-party systems and connection to or are not supported. ocBridge Plus uartBridge

The siren is set up via for iOS, Android, macOS, and Windows. The system notifies users of all events with push notifications, SMS, and calls (if activated). Ajax apps

### Operating principle

StreetSiren DoubleDeck performs two tasks:

1. **Informs about the alarm**. The device responds to triggering of the tamper and security system alarms in less than a second, including a siren and LED backlight, which scares off intruders and attracts the attention of neighbors.

2. **Serves as a security status indicator**. The siren uses LED indication to notify that the object is armed, as well as uses sound and LEDs to notify about the delay when entering/leaving. These functions will be useful when controlling the security system using SpaceControl or KeyPad (the siren reminds you of disarming when you enter the object).

#### What is Delay When Entering/Leaving

When installed properly, it is hard to dismount and disconnect an activated siren: its body is robust, the buzzer protected, and power is from the bundled batteries, so the siren will continue to work even if there is a power outage at the object. Also, if the system is armed, the power button is blocked, preventing the siren from being turned off.

The siren is equipped with a tamper button and an accelerometer. The tamper button is triggered when the device body is opened/broken, and the accelerometer is triggered when somebody's attempting to move or dismantle the device.

#### Connecting a siren to a hub

#### Before starting connection

- **1.** Install the . . Add a hub to the app and create at least one room. Ajax app Create an account
- **2.** Make sure that the hub is on and has Internet access. The status of the Internet connection is available in the Ajax app and is also indicated by the color of the hub's logo (lights white or green).
- **3.** Make sure that the hub **is disarmed** and **is not starting updates**. This can be checked in the Ajax app.

Only users with administrator rights can connect the StreetSiren DoubleDeck to the hub.

### To connect StreetSiren DoubleDeck

- **1.** Go to the **Devices** tab in the Ajax app and click **Add Device**.
- **2.** Name the device, scan or type the QR code (located on the body and packaging), and select the location room.
- **3.** Click **Add**; the countdown will begin.
- **4.** Turn on StreetSiren DoubleDeck by holding the power button for 3 seconds. Keep in mind that the hub connection request is only sent when the siren is turning on.

The power button is recessed into the body and is tight to press. You can use a thin, hard object, like a pencil, to press it.

For detection and pairing to take place, StreetSiren DoubleDeck must be within the hub's radio communication range, i. e. at the same guarded object.

StreetSiren DoubleDeck shuts down automatically 6 seconds after turning on if it failed to connect to the hub. There is no need to deactivate the device to retry the connection. If StreetSiren DoubleDeck has already been assigned to another hub, turn off the siren and follow the standard addition procedure.

The connected siren will appear in the list of hub devices in the app. Updating device statuses in the list depends on the ping time defined in Jeweller settings. The default value is 36 seconds.

### Functionality test

The Ajax security system allows conducting tests for checking the functionality of connected devices.

The tests do not start straight away but not later than over a single hub– detector ping period (36 seconds with the standard settings of the hub). You can change the ping period of devices in the **Jeweller** menu of the hub settings.

**Tests are available in the device settings menu:**

- **Ajax App** → **Devices** → **StreetSiren DoubleDeck** → **Settings**
Jeweller Signal Strength Test

Volume Level Test

#### Attenuation Test

### Choosing a location

The placement of StreetSiren DoubleDeck determines its distance from the hub and the presence of obstacles between them that impede the passage of the radio signal: walls, inter-floor constructions, or large-sized objects located in the room.

When choosing a place, take into account the audibility of the siren, as well as the visibility of its LED indication, as this determines the device performance.

StreetSiren DoubleDeck withstands heat, cold, and temperature drops. The sealed body is certified and complies with protection class IP54. The outdoor siren is protected from rain and snow and can be installed on the facade of the building without a canopy.

> Be sure to check the signal strength at the installation site. If the signal strength is low (a single bar), we cannot guarantee a stable operation of the security system! At the very least, relocate the device as repositioning even by 20 cm can significantly improve the signal reception.

If after moving the device still has a low or unstable signal strength, use a . radio signal range extender

### Installation

### Connecting external power supply

When connecting the external power supply and using StreetSiren DoubleDeck, follow the general electrical safety regulations for using electrical appliances, as well as the requirements of regulatory legal acts on electrical safety.

StreetSiren DoubleDeck runs on bundled battery for up to 5 years and is equipped with terminals for connecting 12V DC external power supply. The connection of external power supply is recommended in order to avoid rapid discharge of batteries in the case of installation in places characterized by low temperatures or when frequent siren activations are reported.

![](_page_17_Picture_1.jpeg)

Before installing the device, be sure to check the insulation of the wires for damage. Use only a grounded power source. It is strictly forbidden to disassemble the device under voltage! Do not use the device with a damaged power cable.

#### **To connect external power supply:**

- **1.** Drill a hole for a cable in the SmartBracket mount.
![](_page_17_Picture_5.jpeg)

- **2.** Route the dead external power cable through the mounting plate.
- **3.** Connect the cable to the terminal strips observing polarity.

![](_page_17_Picture_8.jpeg)

- **4.** Turn on power the **External Power Supply** field value changes to **Connected** in StreetSiren DoubleDeck statuses.
- **5.** Install the siren.

After connecting external power supply, do not remove the batteries from the siren: they act as a backup power source.

> The system will send a notification about the need for service as soon as the battery level drops to 20%.

### Mounting the Brandplate

#### **In order to mount the faceplate:**

- **1.** Turn off the external power of the siren, if connected.
- **2.** Unscrew the fixing screw from the bottom of the siren with a PH2 screwdriver if the siren is mounted on the SmartBracket mounting plate.

![](_page_18_Figure_8.jpeg)

- **3.** Remove the siren from the SmartBracket mounting panel, turning it counterclockwise if the siren is mounted on the mounting plate.
![](_page_19_Picture_0.jpeg)

- **4.** Turn off the device by pressing the power button for 3 seconds.
- **5.** Turn off the external power supply (if applicable) by unscrewing the terminal blocks and disconnecting the power wires.

![](_page_19_Picture_3.jpeg)

- **6.** Place the front side of the siren on a hard surface and unscrew the 4 screws on the rear panel with a PH2 screwdriver.
![](_page_20_Figure_0.jpeg)

- **7.** Turn the siren over while holding the front and back of the body. Remove the protective plastic panel.
![](_page_20_Picture_2.jpeg)

When installing the panel, do not remove the plastic frame and do not remove the LED strip from the seat!

- **8.** Drill a hole in the plastic protective plate at the defined location.
![](_page_21_Picture_0.jpeg)

![](_page_21_Picture_1.jpeg)

Non-hardening sealant may be on the piezoelectric detector and in the hole of the protective plastic panel. Do not wipe it! If the sealant contaminates your hands, wipe it off with a napkin.

- **9.** Mount Brandplate on the protective plastic panel.
![](_page_21_Picture_4.jpeg)

**10.** Fix the Brandplate to the protective plastic panel using the bundled bolt.

![](_page_22_Figure_0.jpeg)

- **11.** Fit the protective plastic panel in place (the Ajax logo on the connection side of the LED strip to the board) with little effort. The properly mounted plastic panel will protrude above the LED frame no more than 1.0 to 1.5 mm.
![](_page_22_Picture_2.jpeg)

- **12.** Turn the siren over while holding the front and back of the body, and tighten 4 screws.
![](_page_23_Figure_0.jpeg)

- **13.** Turn on the siren and check the status of tampers in the app.
### Siren mounting

Before mounting the siren, be sure to choose the optimal location that meets the requirements of this manual.

The recommended installation height is 2.5 meters or more. This will make difficulties for intruders to access the device. If you try to detach the device from the mount, the system will raise an alarm. The security company and users will receive a notification of a sabotage attempt, and the sound of a siren will shock the intruders.

#### **In order to install a siren:**

- **1.** Fasten the SmartBracket mounting plate to the surface using the bundled screws. When using other fasteners, make sure they do not damage or deform the panel.
![](_page_24_Figure_0.jpeg)

Do not use double-sided adhesive tape for either temporary or permanent mounting of the siren. The tape may break off under the weight of the siren. In addition, the tape dries up over time, which may cause the device to fall and the security system to trigger.

- **2.** Mount the siren on the SmartBracket and turn it clockwise.
![](_page_24_Picture_3.jpeg)

- **3.** Secure the siren with a screw. This reduces the risk of burglary.
![](_page_25_Figure_0.jpeg)

#### **Do not install a siren:**

- Near the metal objects and mirrors. They can shield and attenuate the radio signal.
- In places where the audio signal can be jammed.
- Closer than 1 meter to the hub.
- Near the glass break detectors.

#### Maintenance

Check StreetSiren DoubleDeck regularly. Clean the body from dust, cobwebs, and other contaminants as they emerge. Use a soft dry cloth that is suitable for equipment care. Do not use any substances containing alcohol, acetone, gasoline, and other active solvents to clean the device.

The batteries installed in the siren provide up to 5 years of battery life. When the batteries are discharged, the security system will send a corresponding notification, and the LED frame in the lower right corner will light up and go out when the system is arming and disarming (if the indication is disabled), when alarming, dismantling, or opening the siren body.
