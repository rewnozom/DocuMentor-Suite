# Description and functionalities

unum-X ST universal indoor motion detectors with PIR and unum-X DT X5/X8 dual technology with PIR and microwave detection, are professional detectors that guarantee the highest degree of reliability, without incurring any false alarms; they implement Tough Mod2 TM technology, in gold plated, which offers high resistance to heat and humidity and extends the life of the detector.

They are equipped with a mechanism that allows the Fresnel lens to be rotated 180° to obtain two different detection areas:

- . **WIDE** (default) = 12 m detection area and 85° coverage area on horizontal plan (used as volumetric detector)
- . **NARROW** = 18 m detection area and 5° coverage area on horizontal plan (used as curtain detector).

Connection to the lares 4.0 Ksenia control panel is realized by connecting the unum-X alarm and tamper outputs to input terminals of the panel or of any expansion module as NC or to a single input by inserting the balancing resistors, as shown in the figure, and programming the DOUBLE PARALLEL BALANCING. Once associated with the relative "Zones" they can be managed by User and Installer Ksenia Apps.

The jumpers inside the main unit of the device allow the setting of Fresnel lens, PIR sensitivity, Microwave sensitivity and LED indicator; for unum-X DT X5/X8 detectors it is also possible to manage the LED indicator remotely (ON/OFF).
