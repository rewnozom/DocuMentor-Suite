# Chapter 2 Installation and Connections

## 2.1 NVR Installation

During installation of the NVR:

- Use brackets for rack mounting.
- Ensure ample room for audio and video cables.
- When routing cables, ensure that the bend radius of the cables are no less than five times than its diameter.
- Connect the alarm cable.
- Allow at least 2cm (â0.75-inch) of space between racks mounted devices.
- Ensure the NVR is grounded.
- Environmental temperature should be within the range of -10 to +55Âº C, +14 to +131Âº F.
- Environmental humidity should be within the range of 10% to 90%.

## 2.2 Hard Disk Installation

Before you start:

Disconnect the power from the NVR before installing a hard disk drive (HDD). A factory recommended HDD should be used for this installation.

Tools Required: Screwdriver.

Step 1 Remove the cover from the device by unfastening the screws on the bottom.

# Chapter 3 Menu Operation

## 3.1 Startup and Shutdown

Proper startup and shutdown procedures are crucial to expanding the life of the NVR.
