# Pass

## Encrypted contactless card for keypad

*Cards sold in packs of 3, 10 or 100 devices*

### Quick access to the security system

To disarm the security system, just present Pass to the reader on the keypad. This copy-protected card allows you to manage security modes without a password, user account and access to the Ajax app.

#### **Pass is supported by KeyPad Plus.**

### Top-tier data protection

To identify users quickly and securely, KeyPad Plus features the DESFire® technology. It is the best-in-class contactless solution to identify the user by card or key fob.

DESFire® is based on the ISO 14443 international standard and combines comprehensive 128-bit encryption and copy protection. This technology is also used in transportation systems of European capitals and access systems at NASA.

#### Microchip with smart capabilities

From the user perspective, contactless access works simply. To disarm the system, all you need is to present a card or a key fob to the keypad. But there is an impressive technology behind this simplicity. Pass cards are equipped with DESFire® chips. We compared them to the chips used in most access systems around the world.

# One key for home and office

One Pass card can be connected to 13 hubs

# Full control in the app

In the app, you can set the name and access permissions for each card. You always know who and when changed the security mode — every action is recorded in the event log.

A system administrator can revoke or restrict Pass access permissions in real time.

## Effortless connection

To add Pass to the system, all you need is to open the Ajax app, go into the settings and present the card to the keypad.
