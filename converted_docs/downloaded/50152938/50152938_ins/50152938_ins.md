## **1. Technical description.**

## **1.1. General description.**

The **EXT-POE3H extender** is a device designed to increase the PoE and Ethernet range by additional 100 meters using UTP Cat. 5/5e cable. The Extender can be powered using a PoE switch or another PoE-compliant device (PoE IN input). The output voltage and data are available at the PoE OUT1 and OUT2 outputs designed for connecting cameras or other IP devices using PoE power supply. The maximum load current is 0,4A (see Tab.2). The PoE OUT1, PoE OUT2, PoE OUT3 port are supplied over 4/5 (+) and 7/8 (-) pairs, which, according to the Ethernet standard, are not used for data transmission (data transmission uses 1/2 and 3/6 twisted pairs).

## **2. Installation.**

## **2.1. Requirements.**

The extender should be mounted by a qualified installer, holding relevant permits and licenses (applicable and required for a given country) for low-voltage installations. The device should be mounted in a place protected from weather conditions and direct sun, with temperatures from -25°C to + 50°C. Thanks to the use of the OZB1 mounting plate (optional accessory), it is possible to mount the device on a pole (not included).

The device is designed for a 10Mbit/s or 100Mbit/s Ethernet network (the so-called Fast Ethernet). However, it cannot be used in 1Gbit/s networks (the so-called Gigabit Ethernet). The minimum category cable recommended to connect the extender and the network device is UTP Cat. 5 cable. In the case of an external installation, it must be resistant to UV radiation.

## **2.2. Installation procedure.**

Mount the device in the chosen location and route the connection wires (tighten glands; all unused cable entries should be blanked off). Connect the network cables (Ethernet) to the RJ45 connectors marked PoE IN and PoE OUT. Connect the RJ45 cable from the Ethernet switch to the PoE IN jack compatible with the PoE standard, taking into account the current efficiency of the output port. Connect the devices compatible with the IEEE802.3af/at standard, e.g. IP cameras, to the PoE OUT 1/2 ports. All devices using the PoE power with a voltage in the range of 44 ÷ 57VDC can be connected to the PoE OUT3 port.

## **3. Maintenance.**

Any and all maintenance operations may be performed following the disconnection of the power supply from the power network. The power supply does not require any specific maintenance procedures, however, in the case of significant level of dust, it should be cleaned with compressed air.
