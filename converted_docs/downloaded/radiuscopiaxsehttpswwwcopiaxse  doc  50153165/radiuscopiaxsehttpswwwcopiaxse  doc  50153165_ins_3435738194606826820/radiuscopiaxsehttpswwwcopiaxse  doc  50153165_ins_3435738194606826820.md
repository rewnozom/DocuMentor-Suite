![](_page_0_Picture_2.jpeg)

## **INTRODUCTION**

The radius self-powered indoor siren is actually a professional (acoustic & optical) sounder which shows a unique and exclusive design, extremely slim (max. 37 mm thick) associated with a modern technology aimed to combine the best possible performances with the maximum energy saving: very high sound pressure, 3W power LED Alarm Light which also acts as emergency light in case of main power's black-out. The siren is fully controlled by a microprocessor which checks the possible status of the device and sends the appropriate signal. The battery is steadily monitored and its malfunctioning immediately signalized to the lares 4.0 control panel.

On top of the automatic protection for preventing wire-cutting actions, radius is protected by 2 tamper switches against cover opening and against removal from the wall. The siren is equipped with a precision temperature sensor to display the indoor temperature in the ergo Ksenia keypads and for Home Automation applications.
