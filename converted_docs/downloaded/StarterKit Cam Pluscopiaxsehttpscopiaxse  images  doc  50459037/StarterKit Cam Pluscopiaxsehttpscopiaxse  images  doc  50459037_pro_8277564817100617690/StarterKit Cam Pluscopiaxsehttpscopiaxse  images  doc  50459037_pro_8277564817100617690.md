It is equipped with Ethernet port, Wi-Fi module, and 2 SIM cards supporting LTE. Four channels back up each other to guarantee continuous instant alarm communication. Moreover, they allow Ajax to deliver photo verifications to alarm monitoring companies and users in less than 9 seconds. Even over a cellular network.
