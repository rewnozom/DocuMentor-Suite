### Setting up the processing of detector alarms

Through the Ajax app, you can configure which detector alarms can activate the siren. This can help to avoid situations when the security system notifies of LeaksProtect detector alarm or any other device alarm. The parameter is adjusted in the detector or device settings:

- **1.** Sign in to the Ajax app.
- **2.** Go to the **Devices** menu.
- **3.** Select the detector or device.
- **4.** Go to its settings and set the necessary parameters for activating the siren.

### Setting the tamper alarm response

The siren can respond to the tamper alarm of devices and detectors. The option is disabled by default. Note that the tamper reacts to the opening and closing of the body even if the system is not armed!

#### What is a tamper

### **For the siren to respond to tamper triggering, in Ajax app:**

- **1.** Go to the **Devices** menu.
- **2.** Select the hub and go to its settings .
- **3.** Select the **Service** menu.
- **4.** Go to **Siren Settings**.
- **5.** Enable the **Alert with a siren if the hub or detector lid is open** option.

## Setting the response to pressing the panic button in the Ajax app

The siren can respond to pressing the panic button in Ajax apps. Note that the panic button can be pressed even if the system is disarmed!

#### **For the siren to respond to pressing the panic button:**

- **1.** Go to the **Devices** menu.
- **2.** Select the hub and go to its settings .
- **3.** Select the **Service** menu.
- **4.** Go to **Siren Settings**.
- **5.** Enable the **Alert with a siren if in-app panic button is pressed** option.

### Setting the siren after-alarm indication

![](_page_11_Picture_8.jpeg)

The siren can inform about triggerings in the armed system by means of LED indication.

### **The option functions as follows:**

- **1.** The system registers the alarm.
- **2.** The siren plays an alarm (duration and volume depend on settings).
- **3.** The siren LED and external LED (if connected) blinks twice (about once every 3 seconds) until the system is disarmed.

Thanks to this feature, system users and security companies patrols can understand that the alarm has occurred.

![](_page_12_Picture_1.jpeg)

The siren after-alarm indication does not work for always active detectors, if the detector was triggered when the system was disarmed.

#### **To enable the siren after-alarm indication, in :** Ajax PRO app

1. Go to siren settings:

- Hub → Settings → Service → Siren Settings
2. Specify what events the sirens will inform about by double blinking before the security system is disarmed:

- Confirmed alarm
- Unconfirmed alarm
- Lid opening

3. Select the sirens needed. Go back to **Siren Settings**. The set parameters will be saved.

- 4. Click **Back**. All values will be applied.
![](_page_12_Picture_12.jpeg)

HomeSiren with firmware 5.55.2 and later supports this function.

### How to set Chime

Chime is a sound signal that indicates the triggering of the opening detectors when the system is disarmed. The feature is used, for example, in stores, to notify employees that someone has entered the building.

Notifications are configured in two stages: setting up sirens and setting up opening detectors.

![](_page_13_Picture_1.jpeg)

HomeSiren with firmware 5.55.1.0 and later supports this function.

#### **Siren settings**

### Performance testing

The Ajax security system allows conducting tests for checking the functionality of connected devices.

The tests do not start straight away but within a period of 36 seconds when using the standard settings. The test time start depends on the settings of the devices scanning period (the paragraph on "**Jeweller**" settings in hub settings).

Volume Level Test

Jeweller Signal Strength Test

Attenuation Test

### Installing the Siren

Location of the HomeSiren determines its remoteness from the hub and presence of any obstacles between the devices, hindering the radio signal and sound transmission: walls, inserted floors, large-size objects located within the room.

![](_page_15_Picture_9.jpeg)

The device developed only for indoor use.

![](_page_15_Picture_11.jpeg)

Check the signal level at the installation location.

The communication range is up to 2000 meters if there are no obstacles. Please consider it when choosing an installation place for HomeSiren.

If the signal level is one division, we cannot guarantee stable operation of the security system. Take possible measures to improve the quality of the signal! As a minimum, move the device — even 20 cm shift can significantly improve the quality of reception.

If after moving the device still has a low or unstable signal strength, use a . radio signal range extender

Recommended installation height — 2.5 meters and more. This will complicate the access to the device for intruders in case of intrusion.

### Installation process

- **1.** Fix the SmartBracket panel on the surface using bundled screws. After selecting other attachment hardware, make sure that they do not damage or deform the panel.
![](_page_16_Figure_5.jpeg)

![](_page_16_Picture_6.jpeg)

- **2.** Put the siren on the SmartBracket panel and turn it clockwise. When installing in the attachment panel, the tamper will switch and the siren will blink with a LED.
If the light indicator of the siren is not actuated after installation in SmartBracket, check the tamper mode in the Ajax Security System application and then the fixing tightness of the device on the panel.

In case of any attempt to dismount the siren, you will receive the notification.

#### **Do not install the siren:**

- **1.** outside the premises (outdoors)
- **2.** in places where the acoustic signal will be attenuated (inside furniture, behind thick curtains, etc.)
- **3.** nearby any metal objects or mirrors causing attenuation and screening of the signal
- **4.** within any premises with the temperature and humidity beyond the range of permissible limits
- **5.** closer than 1 m from the hub.

### External LED connection

The outside-mounted LED connected to the HomeSiren is paralleled with the built-in LED of the device and completely repeats its indication.

For connection, use the contact on the rear side of the siren body and observe the polarity during the connection. Black terminal wire — "**+**" contact.

**Outlet power supply:** 3 V, 10 mA.

### Siren Maintenance and Battery Replacement

Check the operational capability of the HomeSiren on a regular basis.

Clean the siren body from dust, spider web and other contaminations as they appear. Use soft dry napkin suitable for equipment maintenance.

Do not use for cleaning the siren any substances containing alcohol, acetone, gasoline and other active solvents.

The batteries installed in the siren ensure up to 5 years of autonomous operation (with the inquiry frequency by the hub of 1 minute) or at least 6 hours of the buzzer sound. If the battery is discharged, the security system will send respective notices and the LED will smoothly light up and goes out when the armed mode is activated.
