## **7 EN: Installation Sheet**

#### **Description**

AS61x series is a high quality installer-friendly self activating outdoor siren with a sound output of 120 dB at 1 metre and a single beacon, which meet today's security and environmental requirements. The housing is made of tough UV proof and impact resistant 3.5 mm polycarbonate and has a foamresistant steel inner cover for the ultimate in protection.

AS630 is a high quality installer-friendly self activating outdoor siren with a sound output of 120 dB at 1 metre and a single amber beacon, which meet today's security and environmental requirements. The cover is made of highly polished stainless

steel and has a foam-resistant steel inner cover for the ultimate in protection.

### **Wiring procedure**

First, wire the control panel (power down) to the siren as shown above, before connecting the battery. When the battery is connected for the first time, the siren will give a short beep. The siren cannot be activated until all inputs (input power and hold-off voltages) are correct. The siren will be activated if the input power is removed or drops significantly or if the siren hold-off voltage is removed.

Siren cut-off time is controlled by J1 and J2.

For use without a battery, cut jumper J3.

**Note:** J3 is not available in the AS619 but the AS619 can be used with or without battery.

Figure 7 shows an example connection between the siren and an Advisor Advanced control panel.

**WARNING:** The beacon uses high voltage. To avoid personal injury or death from electrocution, do not touch bare wires and beacon electronics before the energy discharges.
