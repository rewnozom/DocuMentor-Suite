# **Product description**

The Heat Alarm can be installed where smoke or fumes are part of the atmosphere to prevent false alarms.

The Heat Alarm is specifically useful in environments where a traditional optical smoke sensor can cause false detections. The Heat Alarm is designed for installation in private homes or garages with risk for smoky, dusty, or humid environment.

## **Precautions**

- Do not remove the product label as it contains important information.
- Do not paint the alarm.

# **Getting started**

- 3. Make sure that the ZigBee network is open for joining devices and will accept this Heat Alarm.
- 4. While searching for a ZigBee network to join, the LED button flashes red.

# **Modes**

#### **SEARCHING GATEWAY MODE**

Red LED light in the back of the device is flashing every second (up to 15 minutes).

## **NORMAL MODE**

Front LED is flashing every 45 seconds, means that the battery should be replaced.

## **ALARM MODE**

The simultaneous flashing of the front red LED and sounding of intermittent audible signal. When heat is detected, the alarm will sound, press the "button/top" of the Alarm to acknowledge and stop the siren. The following 10 minutes, it will block alarms, allowing time to address the heat..

## **LOW BATTERY MODE**

Simultaneous audible signals and front LED flashes every 45 seconds, means that the battery should be replaced.

## **REPLACE DEVICE MODE**

NOT simultaneous audible signals and front LED flashes every 45 seconds, means that the device should be replaced. The life expectancy of heat alarms is generally 10 years, after which point their sensors begin to lose sensitivity.

## **Fault finding**

- If the Heat Alarm does not work when the test button is pushed, the probable cause is a faulty battery. Replace the battery if it is worn out.
- In case of a bad or weak signal, change the location of the Heat Alarm. Otherwise you can relocate your gateway or strengthen the signal with a smart plug.
- If the search for a gateway has timed out, a short press on the LED button will restart it.
