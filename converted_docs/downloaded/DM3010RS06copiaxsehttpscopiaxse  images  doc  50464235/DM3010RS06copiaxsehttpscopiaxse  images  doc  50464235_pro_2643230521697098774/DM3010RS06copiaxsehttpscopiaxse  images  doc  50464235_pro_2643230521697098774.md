# DM3010RS06

#### **3000 Series intelligent addressable manual call point**

#### **General**

The DM3000 Series is an intelligent range of addressable manual call points. The DM3010RS06 is a red, single action indoor MCP with a House-on-Fire and "BRAND-LARM" functional indication. It is delivered complete with resettable element, test connector and test key. Multiple optional accessories are available to facilitate most indoor installation requirements.

#### **Aesthetics**

This single action MCP is a standard profile, indoor MCP suitable for surface and recess mount installations using standard or legacy European electrical boxes. With its designer dual, tricolour LEDs it offers 180°, clear local indication of its operational status, even from a side view in a passage installation. The clean face of the MCP is further enhanced by a front access & test key facility.

#### **Installation & maintenance friendly**

The front facing access for an aesthetically matching test key allows unhindered access regardless of the installation location. The MCP key doubles as a test and disassembly tool allowing removal of the MCP front cover without the need for additional tools.

#### **Compatibility**

The DM3000 range may be used on compatible Aritech fire systems. They can in many cases be deployed into existing systems without CIE configuration changes.
