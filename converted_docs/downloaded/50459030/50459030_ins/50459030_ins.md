# Operating Principle

DoorProtect Plus consists of two parts: the detector and the constant magnet. The detector is equipped with the sealed contact reed relay, built-in accelerometer, and socket for a third-party wired detector.

Attach the detector to the door frame, while the magnet can be attached to the moving wing or sliding part of the door. If the sealed contact reed relay is within the coverage area of the magnetic field, it closes the circuit, which means that the detector is closed. The opening of the door pushes out the magnet from the sealed contact reed relay and opens the circuit. In such a way, the detector recognizes the opening.

The DoorProtect Plus set includes two constant magnets. The small one works at a distance of 1 cm, and the big one — up to 2 cm.

The detector can be positioned horizontally. If there is no need to detect opening, use only the detector part (without magnets) and disable the primary detector in the settings.

The accelerometer detects shocks and vertical deviation relative to the initial position of more than 5°. DoorProtect Plus can be installed on windows, including dormer windows, and the system can be armed when they are slightly open (disable the primary detector in the settings рreviously).

For detection and pairing to occur, the detector should be located within the coverage area of the wireless network of the hub (at a single protected object). The connection request is transmitted for a short time: at the moment of switching on the device.

If the device failed to pair (LED blinks once per second), switch it off for 5 seconds and retry. The detector connected to the hub appears in the list of devices in the app. The update of the detector statuses in the list depends on the device ping interval set in the hub settings (the default value is 36 seconds).

# How to set Chime

Chime is a sound signal that indicates the triggering of the opening detectors when the system is disarmed. The feature is used, for example, in stores, to notify employees that someone has entered the building.

Notifications are configured in two stages: setting up opening detectors and setting up sirens.

#### Learn more about Chime

# Performance testing

The Ajax security system allows conducting tests for checking the functionality of connected devices.

The tests do not start immediately but within 36 seconds by default. The starting time depends on the ping interval (the paragraph on "**Jeweller**" settings in hub settings).

Jeweller Signal Strength Test

Detection Area Test

Attenuation Test

## Installing the Detector

The location of DoorProtect Plus depends on its remoteness from the hub, and obstacles hindering the radio signal transmission: walls, floors, large objects inside the room.

![](_page_13_Picture_2.jpeg)

The device developed only for indoor use.

![](_page_13_Picture_4.jpeg)

Check the Jeweller signal level at the installation location

If the signal level is low (one bar), we cannot guarantee the stable operation of the detector. Take all possible measures to improve the quality of the signal. At least, move the detector: even a 20 cm shift can significantly improve the quality of signal reception.

If after moving the device still has a low or unstable signal strength, use a . radio signal range extender

#### **Do not install the detector:**

- **1.** outside the premises (outdoors);
- **2.** nearby any metal objects or mirrors causing attenuation or screening of the signal;
- **3.** at any places with fast air circulation (air fans, open windows or doors);
- **4.** inside premises with the temperature and humidity beyond the range of permissible limits;
- **5.** closer than 1 m to the hub.

**Attach the magnet to the right of the detector**. The side to which the magnet should be attached is marked with an arrow on the detector's body. The detector is located either inside or outside the door case (window frame).

![](_page_14_Picture_0.jpeg)

When installing the detector in the perpendicular planes (inside the case/frame), use the small magnet from the set. The distance between the magnet and detector should not exceed 1 cm.

When positioning the parts of DoorProtect Plus in the same plane, use the big magnet. Its actuation threshold is 2 cm.

# Detector Testing

Having defined the location, fix the detector and magnet with the double-sided adhesive tape and check its operation of using the Detection Zone test.

In the test mode, the DoorProtect Plus LED lights continuously, switching off for a second, if the detector is triggered. Check the correct operation of the device by opening/closing the door several times.

# Connecting a Third-Party Wired Detector

A wired detector with an NC (normally closed) contact type can be connected to DoorProtect Plus using the in-built terminal clamp.

![](_page_15_Picture_0.jpeg)

We recommend installing the wired detector at a distance no longer than 1 meter to DoorProtect Plus. Longer wire length increases the risk of its damage and reduces the quality of communication between the detectors.

To put out the wire from the detector body, break out the plug:

![](_page_15_Picture_3.jpeg)

If the connected wired detector is triggered, you receive the notification.

To make sure the alarm is raised when the roller shutter is opened, connect the wired roller shutter motion detector with the NC (normally closed) contact to DoorProtect Plus. The function is available for the devices with firmware version 5.53.1.0 and higher.

#### How to find the firmware version or the ID of the sensor or device?

#### How to connect the roller shutter motion detector to DoorProtect Plus

### Installation

Before installing the detector, make sure that you have selected the optimal location that follows the guidelines of this manual!

- **1.** Fix the SmartBracket attachment panel using bundled screws. If you use any other attachment tools, make sure that they do not damage or deform the attachment panel.
Use double-side adhesive tape only for temporary attachment of the detector. The tape runs dry with time, which can cause falling, false triggering, and detector malfunction.

- **2.** Put the detector on the attachment panel. When the detector is fixed in SmartBracket, it blinks with LED, signaling that the tamper is closed. If LED doesn't blink after fixing in SmartBracket, check the status of the tamper in the Ajax app and then the fixing tightness of the panel.
If someone detaches the detector from the surface or takes it off the attachment panel, the security system notifies you.

- **3.** Put the magnet on the attachment panel.
### Maintenance

Check the operational capability of the detector regularly. Clean the detector body from dust, spider web, and other contaminants as they appear. Use soft dry napkin suitable for tech equipment.

Do not use any substances containing alcohol, acetone, gasoline, and other active solvents to clean the detector.

The battery life depends on its quality, detector triggering frequency, and ping interval by the hub.

If the door opens 10 times a day and the detector ping interval is 60 seconds, then DoorProtect Plus operates 7 years from the pre-installed battery. For instance, a 12-seconds ping interval reduces the battery life to 2 years.

#### How long Ajax devices operate on batteries, and what affects this

If the detector battery is low, the system notifies the user, and the LED indicator smoothly lights up and goes off if a glass break is detected or the tamper is triggered.
