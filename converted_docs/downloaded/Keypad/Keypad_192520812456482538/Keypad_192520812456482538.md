# **Keypad Enables secure access control**

The Zigbee-based Keypad includes a tag reader and allows for users to enable and disable an alarm system using a pin code and/or an RFID tag. In addition, access data can be updated remotely via a gateway to facilitate access control.

Key features are:

- RFID tag reader
- Battery-powered
- Tamper-protected
- Buzzer and LED

## **Saves battery when not in use**

The RFID only consumes energy when it is needed. The Keypad includes a sensor that detects when a person is within operating distance, which will enable the RFID and make the Keypad light up in the dark. This saves energy and allows for a longer battery lifetime.
