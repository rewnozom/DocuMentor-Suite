# XT-5 UHF Reader

# Automatic Vehicle Identification

![](_page_0_Picture_3.jpeg)

## KEY FEATURES

- Advanced Linux based UHF reader with PoE+
- High power radio with polarization control
- Self-jammer cancellation (SJC)
- Read range up to 12m (40ft)
- Additional external antenna as option

## A world leading reader

The XT-5 is our most advanced integrated reader to this date. It has an advanced radio design with high output power, self-jammer cancellation (SJC) and control of antenna polarization (which can be set to vertical, horizontal or circular). It supports both PoE+ (Power over Ethernet) and conventional power supply. It has a high performance processor running Linux and supports a SDK (Software Development Kit). The bright LEDs for visual indication are implemented as RGB (Red/Green/Blue).

An external antenna can be connected, and also this external antenna supports polarization control and RGB LEDs, all using a single RF cable connected to the reader.

## Unmatched flexibility

The XT-5 is easy to install, configure and use. The reader is intended for outdoor usage and is well suited for the toughest environments. XT-5 has a wide number of built-in interfaces including Ethernet (2 separate ports), RS232, RS485 and Wiegand/Magstripe as well as the option to add an additional external antenna. All this together with the SDK supporting development of customer specific software give an unmatched flexibility.

Using a unique firmware implementation the TagMaster readers in a single installation communicates real-time information (per separate antenna) to accurately distinguish and discriminate tags from adjacent lanes using the Distributed Cross Read Elimination (DCRE) feature. The readers also have Distributed Duty Cycling (DDC) ensuring

that adjacent readers/antennas do not read simultaneously and thereby achieving absolutely optimal reading conditions.

#### RAIN compliant

The TagMaster XT-5 is fully compliant with RAIN. The XT-5 includes TagMaster's SecureMarkID® tag format, which is developed to ensure that each UHF tag has a unique identity which is difficult to duplicate. The XT-5 combined with our SecureMarkID® tags provides a higher level of security.
