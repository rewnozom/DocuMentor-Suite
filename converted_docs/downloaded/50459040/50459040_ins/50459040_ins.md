# Operating Principle

Thermal PIR sensor of MotionProtect detects intrusion into protected room by detecting moving objects whose temperature is close to the temperature of the human body. However, the detector can ignore domestic animals if the suitable sensitivity has been chosen in the settings.

When the **MotionProtect Plus** detects motion, it will additionally carry out radio frequency scanning of the room, preventing false actuation from thermal interferences: air flows from sun-heated curtains and louvre shutters, operating thermal air fans, fireplaces, air conditioning units, etc.

After actuation, the armed detector immediately transmits an alarm signal to the hub, activating the sirens and notifying the user and security company.

If before arming the system, the detector has detected motion, it will not arm immediately, but during the next inquiry by the hub.

Before using the detector as a part of the security system, set up the suitable sensitivity level.

Switch the **Always Active** if the detector is located in a room requiring 24-hour control. Regardless of whether the system is set in the armed mode, you will receive notices of any detected motion.

If any motion is detected, the detector activates the LED for 1 second and transmits an alarm signal to the hub and then to the user and central monitoring station (if it is connected).

# Detector Testing

The Ajax security system allows conducting tests for checking the functionality of connected devices.

The tests do not start immediately but within a period of 36 seconds when using the standard settings. The time of the start depends on the settings of the detector polling period (the paragraph on **Jeweller** settings in the hub settings).

### Jeweller Signal Strength Test

Detection Zone Test

Attenuation test

### Device installation

### Selection of the Detector Location

The controlled area and the efficiency of the security system depends on the location of the detector.

Location of MotionProtect depends on the remoteness from the hub and presence of any obstacles between the devices hindering the radio signal transmission: walls, inserted floors, large-size objects located within the room.

![](_page_9_Figure_2.jpeg)

If the signal level is at one bar, we cannot guarantee stable operation of the security system. Take all possible measures to improve the quality of the signal! As a minimum, move the device — even 20 cm shift can significantly improve the quality of reception.

If after moving the device still has a low or unstable signal strength, use a . radio signal range extender

> The direction of the detector lens should be perpendicular to the probable way of intrusion into the room

Make sure that any furniture, domestic plants, vases, decorative or glass structures do not block the field of view of the detector.

We recommend installing the detector at the height of 2,4 meters.

If the detector is not installed at the recommended height, this will reduce the area of the motion detection zone and impair the operation of the function of ignoring animals.

#### Why motion detectors react to animals and how to avoid it

# Installation of the Detector

Before installing the detector, make sure that you have selected the optimal location and it is in compliance with the guidelines contained in this manual

![](_page_11_Picture_0.jpeg)

The Ajax MotionProtect detector (**MotionProtect Plus**) should be attached to a vertical surface or in the corner.

![](_page_11_Figure_2.jpeg)

- **1.** Attach the SmartBracket panel to the surface using bundled screws, using at least two fixing points (one of them — above the tamper). After selecting other attachment screws, make sure that they do not damage or deform the panel.
The double-sided adhesive tape may only be used for temporary attachment of the detector. The tape will run dry in the course of time, which may result in the falling of the detector and actuation of the security system. Furthermore, hitting can damage the device.

- **2.** Put the detector on the attachment panel. When the detector is fixed in SmartBracket, it will blink with an LED — this will be a signal that the tamper on the detector is closed.
If the LED indicator of the detector is not actuated after installation in SmartBracket, check the status of the tamper in the and then the fixing tightness of the panel. Ajax Security System application

If the detector is torn off from the surface or removed from the attachment panel, you will receive the notification.

#### **Do not install the detector:**

- **1.** outside the premises (outdoors)
- **2.** in the direction of the window, when the detector lens is exposed to direct sunlight (you can install **MotionProtect Plus**)
- **3.** opposite any object with the rapidly changing temperature (e.g., electrical and gas heaters) (you can install **MotionProtect Plus**)
- **4.** opposite any moving objects with a temperature close to that of the human body (oscillating curtains above the radiator) (you can install **MotionProtect Plus**)
- **5.** at any places with fast air circulation (air fans, open windows or doors) (you can install **MotionProtect Plus**)
- **6.** nearby any metal objects or mirrors causing attenuation and screening of the signal
- **7.** within any premises with the temperature and humidity beyond the range of permissible limits
- **8.** closer than 1 m from the hub.

# Detector Maintenance

Check the operational capability of the Ajax MotionProtect detector on a regular basis.

Clean the detector body from dust, spider webs and other contaminants as they appear. Use soft dry napkin suitable for equipment maintenance.

Do not use any substances containing alcohol, acetone, gasoline and other active solvents for cleaning the detector. Wipe the lens very carefully and gently — any scratches on the plastic may cause reduction of the detector sensitivity.

The pre-installed battery ensures up to 5 years of autonomous operation (with the inquiry frequency by the hub of 3 minutes). If the detector battery is discharged, the security system will send respective notices and the LED will smoothly lights up and goes out, if the detector detects any motion or if the tamper is actuated.
