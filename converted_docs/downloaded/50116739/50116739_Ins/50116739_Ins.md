## **Chapter 2 Installation and Connections**

## **2.1 NVR Installation**

During installation of the NVR:

- **1.** Use brackets for rack mounting.
- **2.** Ensure ample room for audio and video cables.
- **3.** When routing cables, ensure that the bend radius of the cables are no less than five times than its diameter.
- **4.** Connect the alarm cable.
- **5.** Allow at least 2cm (≈0.75-inch) of space between racks mounted devices.
- **6.** Ensure the NVR is grounded.
- **7.** Environmental temperature should be within the range of -10 ºC ~ 55 ºC, 14ºF ~ 131ºF.
- **8.** Environmental humidity should be within the range of 10% ~ 90%.

## **2.2 Hard Disk Installation**

#### *Before you start:*

Disconnect the power from the NVR before installing a hard disk drive (HDD). A factory recommended HDD should be used for this installation. Up to eight SATA hard disks can be installed.

**Tools Required:** Screwdriver.

#### *Steps:*

- **1.** Remove the NVR cover by unfastening the screws on the back and side.
![](_page_10_Picture_18.jpeg)

Figure 2. 1 Remove the Cover

- **2.** Install the HDD in the HDD rack using the provided screws. Fasten the screws on the button to fix the HDD.
![](_page_11_Picture_1.jpeg)

Figure 2. 2 Install the HDD

- **3.** Connect one end of the data cable to the NVR motherboard and the other end to the HDD.
![](_page_11_Picture_4.jpeg)

Figure 2. 3 Connect the data cable

- **4.** Connect the power cable to the HDD.
![](_page_11_Picture_7.jpeg)

Figure 2. 4 Connect the power cable

- **5.** Re-install the NVR cover and fasten screws.
### **2.3 Connections**

### **Wiring of Alarm Input**

The alarm input is an open/closed relay. To connect the alarm input to the device, use the following diagram.

![](_page_12_Picture_4.jpeg)

If the alarm input is not an open/close relay, please connect an external relay between the alarm input and the device.

![](_page_12_Figure_6.jpeg)

Figure 2. 5 Alarm Input Wiring

### **Wiring of Alarm Output**

To connect to an alarm output (AC or DC load), use the following diagram:

![](_page_12_Figure_10.jpeg)

Figure 2. 6 Alarm Output Wiring

For DC load, the jumpers can be used within the limit of 12V/1A safely.

To connect an AC load, jumpers should be left open (you must remove the jumper on the motherboard in the NVR). Use an external relay for safety (as shown in the figure above).

There are 4 jumpers (JP1, JP2, JP3, and JP4) on the motherboard, each corresponding with one alarm output. By default, jumpers are connected. To connect an AC load, jumpers should be removed.

#### *Example:*

If you connect an AC load to the alarm output 3 of the NVR, then you must remove the JP 3 jumper.

### **Using Alarm Connectors**

To connect alarm devices to the NVR:

- **1.** Disconnect *pluggable block* from the ALARM IN /ALARM OUT terminal block.
- **2.** Unfasten stop screws from the *pluggable block*, insert signal cables into slots and fasten stop screws. Ensure signal cables are tight.
- **3.** Connect *pluggable block* back into terminal block.

### **Controller Connection**

![](_page_13_Figure_7.jpeg)

![](_page_13_Figure_8.jpeg)

To connect a controller to the NVR:

- **1.** Disconnect pluggable block from the KB terminal block.
- **2.** Unfasten stop screws from the KB D+, D- *pluggable block*, insert signal cables into slots and fasten stop screws. Ensure signal cables are in tight.
- **3.** Connect Ta on controller to D+ on terminal block and Tb on controller to D- on terminal block. Fasten stop screws.
- **4.** Connect *pluggable block* back into terminal block.

![](_page_13_Picture_14.jpeg)

Make sure both the controller and NVR are grounded.
