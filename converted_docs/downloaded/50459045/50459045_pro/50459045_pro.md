## MotionProtect Outdoor

Wireless outdoor motion detector with intelligent protection against false alarms. The device operates at low temperatures and is protected against dust and splashes.

- Authentication to prevent forgery
- Jamming detection and communication channels encryption
- Tampering alarm

# LISA intelligent algorithm for false alarm prevention

### Accurately detects people

LISA turns MotionProtect Outdoor into a formidable barrier for intruders. The digital algorithm accurately identifies the movement of a person while ignoring animals, swaying of trees and plants as well as birds and insects that land on the detector.

#### Ignores all unimportant events

LISA analyses the similarity of signals originating from two sensors in two stages. If the signals appear similar during the first stage but the detected similarity is insufficient to trigger an alarm, the comparison of the spectral components is initiated. It helps to ignore trees swaying in the detector's field of vision.

* The detector ignores bushes up to 80 cm high and trees whose crowns cross only the upper beam

#### Prevents intrusions invisible with the naked eye

The MotionProtect Outdoor features the maximum possible protection for outdoor detectors. The anti-masking function, which is on around the clock by default, detects installation of barriers, pasting over, application of paint on one or two lenses. The integrated tamper alarms if the dust- and moisture-proof detector body is opened.

- Anti-masking
- Detects painting and pasting of the detector
- Protection against unauthorized opening

### Ready to operate straight out the box

MotionProtect Outdoor comes with pre-installed battery, so you do not need to disassemble it. The detector can be connected to the hub by one click in the mobile application. It can be mounted at a height of 0.8 to 1.3 meters on the SmartBracket in just a few minutes. Although the complete battery life is 5 years, it is possible to connect external power supply.
