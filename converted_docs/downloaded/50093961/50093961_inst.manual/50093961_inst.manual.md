# *Universal Mounting Kit*

The Universal Mounting Kit (UMK) is a versatile reader bracket that can be used for wall or pole mounting of the LR-series readers. The UMK is very easy to assemble and configure. The possibility to adjust tilt and swivel angle enables optimal tuning of the reader position. The bracket is suitable for both indoor and outdoor use. The kit contains all parts needed for mounting a reader (see "Configuration options and list of contents"). Each kit contains an assembly instruction that describes options for configuration and installation of the UMK.

#### Wall configuration

The Wall bracket can be mounted on flat surfaces such as walls or ceilings. The UMK is configured for WALL installation from factory. Wall mounting bolts are not included in the kit since the choice of bolts is dependant of the surface material.

#### Pole configuration

The Pole bracket can be mounted on poles or comparable equipment. The factory set UMK has to be reconfigured for POLE installation. The UMK is reconfigured by removing the Adaptor and assembling it with the Pole bracket (see "Configuration options and list of contents").
