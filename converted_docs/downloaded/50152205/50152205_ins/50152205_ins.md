# Port Connection

### PoE Port Connection:

Connect the switch to the PoE ports of an opposite end device, including network camera, IP camera, NVR, switch, etc.

![](_page_1_Figure_53.jpeg)

Fiber Optical Port Connection:

Do not bend fiber optic (curvature radius ≥ 10 cm) overly. Do not look directly at fiber optic connector for laser is harmful to eyes. • •

- Connect the two paired SFP optical module with an optical fiber. 1.
- Hold SFP optical module from one side, and smoothly plug it into the switch along with the SFP port slot until optical module and the switch are closely attached. 2.
- After powering on your switch, check the status of Link/Act indicator. If the indicator is lit, the link is connected. If the indicator is unlit, the link is disconnected. Check the line, and make sure opposite devices have been started. 3.
