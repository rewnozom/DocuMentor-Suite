## **PowerWalker VFI 6000-10000 TGB/TGS Series**

- True Double Conversion Technology with high output Power Factor 1.0
- Human Interface Device (HID) compatible USB connection (no additional drivers needed)
- Highly efficient (>95%), Energy saving solution with long autonomy time in great price
- 3-level inverter topology for increased efficiency and high power density
- Parallel operation up to 3 units of the same size

The PowerWalker VFI 1000-10000 TG/TGB/TGS offer a professional solution for home and office environment. They are available with different designs:

- TG: With internal battery; ranges from 1000-3000VA
- TGB: With internal battery and battery connector for external battery packs; ranges from 1000-10000VA
- TGS: Without internal batteries, but with a strong charger and battery connector; ranges from 1000-10000VA

The VFI TG/TGB/TGS series are detected as Human Interface Device (HID) Power Device by the internal O/S drivers and can be managed without additional software. It finds its application in all dedicated systems for kiosks, ATMs as well as in high security level systems, where additional software is not allowed (i.e. banking).
