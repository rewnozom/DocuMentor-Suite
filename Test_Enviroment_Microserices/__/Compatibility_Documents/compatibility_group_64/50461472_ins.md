# Operating principle

MultiTransmitter is designed to integrate third-party wired detectors and devices to an Ajax security system. The integration module receives information about alarms, events and malfunctions from detectors and devices via a wired connection. Then the integration module transmits the event to the hub using the Jeweller wireless communication protocol. The hub sends notifications to users and the security company's Central Monitoring Station (CMS).

![](_page_4_Picture_3.jpeg)

MultiTransmitter can be used to connect alarm and medical alert buttons, indoor and outdoor motion detectors, as well as detectors that track opening, vibration, glass breaking, fire, gas and water leakage, etc.

The device type is indicated in the zone settings to which the wired detector or device is connected. The selected type determines the text of notifications about alarms and events of the connected device, as well as event codes transmitted to the CMS.

### **A total of 9 types of events are available for the devices connected to MultiTransmitter:**

MultiTransmitter has 18 wired zones. It is recommended to connect one device to one zone. The number of connected devices depends on their power consumption. The maximum consumption of all devices or detectors connected to all zones is 1 A.

The integration module has four 10.5–15 V⎓ power supply lines: one for fire detectors and three for other devices.

> After the fire alarm, fire detectors need a power reset to restore normal operation. Therefore, the power supply of fire detectors should only be connected to a dedicated line. Also, avoid connecting other detectors and devices to the fire detectors power supply terminals as this may lead to false alarms or incorrect operation of the devices.

#### **Supported connection types:**

- NO (normally open).
- NC (normally closed).
- EOL (connection with one resistor).
- 2EOL (connection with two resistors).
- 3EOL (connection with three resistors).

The device supports EOL with resistance from 1 to 15 kΩ, the total resistance of all resistors is up to 30 kΩ. To increase the protection against sabotage, EOL resistors with different resistance can be used in one detector. Recommendation resistance ratio of EOL resistors: R1=R, R2=2·R, R3=3·R.

In the Ajax app, you can select the normal state (normally closed or normally open) for each of the terminal pairs: alarm, tamper, and malfunction. This allows connecting any potential-free contact detector of any configuration to MultiTransmitter.

> 2EOL and 3EOL connections are only available for MultiTransmitter with firmware version 2.13.0 and higher. The integration module should be connected to Hub Plus, Hub 2 (2G), Hub 2 (4G), Hub 2 Plus, Hub Hybrid (2G), or Hub Hybrid (4G) with the OS Malevich 2.13 firmware version and higher.

### How to connect a wired detector or device to MultiTransmitter

## Jeweller radio communication technology

Jeweller is a radio protocol that provides fast and reliable two-way communication between the hub and the devices of the system. Protocol instantly sends informative alarm notifications: security companies and users know exactly which one device triggered, when and where it happened.

Jeweller supports encryption and authentication to prevent sabotage, and regular polls to display device status in real-time. Jeweller supports up to 2,000 m of wireless connectivity, providing the facilities protection and the best user experience for both system owners and installers.

### Transmitting events to the monitoring station

The Ajax security system can transmit events and alarms to the monitoring app, as well as to the Central Monitoring Station (CMS) in **Sur-Gard (Contact ID)**, **SIA (DC-09)**, **ADEMCO 685**, and other proprietary protocol formats. A complete list of supported protocols is . Ajax PRO Desktop available here

#### Which CMSs can the Ajax security system be connected to

#### **MultiTransmitter can transmit the following events:**

- **1.** MultiTransmitter tampers alarm / restoration.
- **2.** Connected devices alarm / restoration.
- **3.** Loss / restoration of connection between MultiTransmitter and the hub / radio signal range extender.
- **4.** Loss / restoration of connection between MultiTransmitter and the devices connected to it.
- **5.** Temporary deactivation / activation of MultiTransmitter.
- **6.** Temporary deactivation / activation of wired detectors and devices connected to MultiTransmitter.
- **7.** Unsuccessful attempt to arm the security system (if is enabled). system integrity check

In the event of an alarm, the monitoring station operator of the security company knows what happened and where the rapid response unit has to be sent. All Ajax devices are addressable, so events, the device type, its assigned name and room can be transmitted to PRO Desktop and the CMS. The list of transmittable parameters may differ depending on the CMS type and the selected communication protocol with the monitoring station.

# Adding MultiTransmitter to the system

Wired detectors can be connected to MultiTransmitter both before adding the module to the hub and after that.

# Before adding the integration module

- **1.** Install the Ajax app. Create an account if you don't have one.
- **2.** Add a hub compatible with the integration module to the app, configure the necessary settings, and create at least one virtual room.
- **3.** Make sure the hub is enabled and has Internet access: via Ethernet, Wi-Fi, and/or cellular network. You can do it in the Ajax app or by looking at the hub LED indicator. It should light up in white or green.
- **4.** Make sure the hub is not updated and not disarmed by checking its status in the Ajax app.

### How to add MultiTransmitter

- **1.** Open the Ajax app. Go to the **Devices** tab and press **Add device**.
- **2.** Name the integration module.
- **3.** Scan QR code or type the device ID. You can find the QR code on the back of the casing, on the board and packaging of the device. The device ID is below the QR code.

![](_page_9_Picture_8.jpeg)

- **4.** Choose a virtual room and group (if the Group mode is enabled).
- **5.** Click **Add**.
- **6.** Enable the MultiTransmitter by pressing the power button for 3 seconds. Note that a request to connect to the hub is sent at the very moment the integration module is turning on. If the connection fails, turn off MultiTransmitter for 5 seconds and try again.

![](_page_10_Picture_0.jpeg)

If the maximum number of devices has already been added to the hub, you will receive an error notification when adding.

MultiTransmitter works with one hub only. After connecting to the new hub, the integration module stops exchanging commands with the previous one. When added to a new hub, MultiTransmitter is not removed from the previous hub list of devices. Remove it via the Ajax app.

The connected integration module appears in the hub device list in the app. Device status updating depends on the polling interval adjusted in the **Jeweller** or **Jeweller/Fibra** settings (36 seconds by default).

# MultiTransmitter malfunctions

![](_page_15_Picture_2.jpeg)

If the MultiTransmitter malfunction is detected (e. g., loss of connection with the hub via Jeweller), the Ajax app displays a malfunction counter in the upper left corner of the device icon.

All faults can be seen in the . Fields with malfunctions will be highlighted in red. integration module states

#### **The malfunction is displayed if:**

- The integration module casing is open or dismantled from the surface (tamper alarms).
- There is no connection between the integration module and the hub/radio signal range extender via Jeweller.
- The battery is discharged.
- The battery charges for more than 40 hours.
- Failed to connect a backup battery (the battery is not connected or there are hardware problems, such as a faulty connection cable).
- The detector power supply line is shorted out.

MultiTransmitter can report malfunctions to the security company monitoring station, as well as to users via push notifications and SMS.

# MultiTransmitter placement

![](_page_16_Picture_10.jpeg)

When choosing the place to install MultiTransmitter, consider the parameters affecting the correct operation of the integration module:

- Jeweller signal strength.
- Distance from the hub.
- Presence of obstacles for the passage of the radio signal between integration module and hub: walls, floors, dimensional objects.
- Cable length for connecting wired detectors and devices to MultiTransmitter.

Consider placement guidelines when designing your security system. The design and installation of the security system should be carried out by professionals. The list of authorized Ajax partners is . available here

# Signal strength

The Jeweller signal strength is determined by the number of undelivered or damaged data packets exchanged between the hub and the detector during a certain time. The signal strength is indicated by the icon in the **Devices** tab:

- **Three bars** excellent signal strength.
- **Two bars** good signal strength.
- **One bar** low signal strength, the stable operation is not guaranteed.
- **Crossed out icon** no signal.

Check the Jeweller signal strength at the installation location. With a low signal strength (one or zero bars), we do not guarantee stable operation of the security system. In this case, we recommend moving the device as changing the position even by 20 centimeters can significantly improve the quality of radio communication. If the integration module still has a low or unstable signal strength after moving, use a . radio signal range extender

# Do not install MultiTransmitter

- Outdoors. This may lead to integration module failure.
- Inside any premises with the temperature and humidity parameters that do not correspond to the device operating range. This may lead to integration module failure.
- In locations where the integration module has a Jeweller signal strength of zero or one bar. This could result in the loss of connection with the integration module.
- At a distance of less than one meter from the hub or radio signal range extender. This could result in the loss of connection with the integration module.

## Installing MultiTransmitter

Before installing MultiTransmitter, make sure that you have chosen the optimal location and that it meets the conditions of this manual. Run the Jeweller Signal Strength Test before final installation.

MultiTransmitter is designed for indoor installation. We recommend choosing the installation location hidden from eyes.

Use the fasteners from the installation kit to mount the integration module on a vertical surface. All the necessary holes are already made.

#### **To install the module:**

- **1.** Prepare the cable outputs in advance by carefully breaking out the perforated parts of the MultiTransmitter casing.
![](_page_18_Picture_8.jpeg)

- **2.** Secure the casing on the vertical surface at the selected installation location with the bundled screws using all fixation points. One of them is in the
perforated part above the tamper and required for its triggering in case of any attempt to detach the MultiTransmitter casing from the surface.

![](_page_19_Picture_1.jpeg)

- **3.** Install the MultiTransmitter board into the casing on the holders.
![](_page_19_Picture_3.jpeg)

- **4.** Install a 12 V⎓ backup battery at the special fixation racks in the casing. Note that third-party power supply units cannot be connected to the terminals.
We recommend using a 12 V⎓ battery with a capacity of 4 or 7 A∙h. For such batteries there are special racks in the casing. You can also use similar batteries of a different capacity if their size fits the casing, and the maximum full charge time doesn't exceed 30 hours. The maximum battery dimensions for installing in the casing are 150 × 65 × 94 mm, and the maximum weight is 5 kg.

#### **5.** Connect wired detectors and devices to the integration module.

- **6.** Connect the backup battery to the board terminals according to the diagram below using the connection cable from the complete set. Observe the
polarity of wire connection. Securely fasten the wires in the terminals.

![](_page_20_Picture_1.jpeg)

- **7.** Turn on the integration module.
- **8.** Install the lid on the integration module casing and secure it in the lower and upper parts of the casing using the screws from the installation kit.

# Connecting wired detectors and devices to MultiTransmitter

# Preparation and cable length

Carefully read the user manual for the third-party wired detector or device before connecting it to MultiTransmitter. If you have any questions, please contact the technical support of the detector or device manufacturer.

Violation of the basic installation rules, the recommendations of this manual and the instructions of the manufacturers of third-party wired detectors or

devices can lead to their incorrect operation and false alarms.

When planning where to install the integration module or connected wired devices, consider the wiring diagram of the power cables at the facility. Signal cables for security system devices must be laid at a distance of at least 50 cm from the power cables in case of parallel routing. If cables intersect, keep the 90° angle.

For facilities that are under construction or renovation, cables are laid after the facility electrical wiring is installed. Use protective tubes, ties, clips, and staples to organize and secure the cables. Make sure that the fasteners do not damage the cables or their insulation during installation.

When laying cables externally (without mounting them inside the walls), use an electric channel raceway. Raceways should be no more than half-filled with cables. Do not allow cables to sag. The raceway should be hidden from view if possible — for example, behind furniture.

> We recommend laying cables inside the walls, floors, and ceilings. This will provide greater security: the cables will not be visible, and it will be impossible for an intruder to access them.

When installing, observe the bend radius that the manufacturer specifies in the cable specs. Otherwise, you risk damaging or breaking it.

Before installation, check all cables for bends and physical damage. Perform the installation in a way that minimizes the possibility of damage to the cables from the outside.

We recommend using signal copper-plated aluminum cable with a 0.22 mm² cross-section. The maximum length of the signal cable used to connect thirdparty devices to MultiTransmitter is 400 meters . The value may vary if a different type of cable is used. No other types of cables have been tested.

### Connecting to MultiTransmitter

When connecting to the integration module, do not twist the wires together; solder them. The ends of the wires which will be connected into the integration module terminals should be tinned or crimped with a special sleeve. This will ensure a reliable connection. **Follow safety precautions and electrical installation rules when connecting the integration module and third-party detectors and devices**.

- **1.** Select the MultiTransmitter zone to connect a detector or device.
- **2.** Route the cable into the integration module casing.
- **3.** Connect third-party wired detectors or devices to the appropriate MultiTransmitter terminals. The wiring diagram can be found in the user manual provided by the manufacturer of the wired device.

![](_page_22_Picture_4.jpeg)

Carefully read the manufacturer's instructions before connecting the device to MultiTransmitter.

- **4.** Securely fasten the wires in the terminals.
- **5.** Fix the cable with ties using special fasteners inside the casing.

![](_page_22_Picture_8.jpeg)

If the wired detector or device requires a 12 V⎓ power supply, it can be connected to the power terminals of the corresponding MultiTransmitter zone. Separate terminals are provided for fire detectors. Do not connect external power supply (such as third-party power supply units) to the detector power terminals, as this may damage the device.

### **6.** Add a detector or device to the system.

### Adding to the system

### How to configure Chime

The **Chime** is an audio signal notifying about the opening detectors triggering when the system is disarmed. The feature is used, for example, in stores to notify employees that someone has entered the door.

The notification is set in two stages: configuring the opening detectors and configuring the sirens.

#### Configuring a wired opening detector connected to MultiTransmitter

Before setting up the Chime feature, make sure that a wired opening detector is connected to MultiTransmitter and the following options have been configured in the detector settings in the Ajax app:

- Type of Event Intrusion.
- Operating Mode Bistable.
- Always Active disabled.
- **1.** Go to the **Devices** tab.
- **2.** Select **MultiTransmitter** in the list.
- **3.** Click **Devices** under the MultiTransmitter icon.
- **4.** Select the device from the list.
- **5.** Go to **Settings** by clicking on the gear icon .
- **6.** Go to the **Chime** menu.
- **7.** Select the siren notification of the event and press **If device is triggered**.
- **8.** Select the chime sound: 1 to 4 short beeps. Once selected, the Ajax app will play the sound.
- **9.** Click **Back** to save the settings.
- **10.** Set up the required siren.

## Malfunctions of connected wired detectors and devices

If a malfunction is detected in a wired detector or device, the Ajax app displays a malfunction counter in the upper left corner of the device icon.

All malfunctions can be seen in the . Fields with faults will be highlighted in red. states of connected device

#### **The malfunctions are displayed if:**

- The enclosure of the device is open (tamper triggering).
- No connection between the integration module and the device (contacts are damaged).
- Incorrect connection of resistors (resistance of resistor error).
- The system has detected a short circuit in the device contacts.

The connected device can report malfunctions to the security company monitoring station, as well as to users via push notifications and SMS.

### Fire alarms reset

In case of alarms of fire detectors connected to MultiTransmitter, the Ajax app displays the notifications prompting to reset the alarms. The reset returns the detectors to their normal state so they can continue detecting a fire.

### **If you do not reset the alarm after a fire alarm, the detectors will not respond to the next fire, as they will remain in alarm mode.**

There are two ways to reset fire alarms:

- **1.** By clicking the button in the notification in the app.
- **2.** Via the MultiTransmitter menu: click the red button opposite the integration module.

### MultiTransmitter indication

![](_page_35_Picture_1.jpeg)

The MultiTransmitter LED indicator may light up in white, red, or green depending on the device status. Note that the LED indicator is not visible if the lid is closed, but you can check the device status in the Ajax app.

![](_page_35_Picture_3.jpeg)

If MultiTransmitter is not added to the hub or has lost connection with it, the integration module will not indicate the battery status or the presence of external power.

# MultiTransmitter functionality test

Ajax security system provides several tests to correctly select the location of devices. The MultiTransmitter tests do not begin immediately, but not later than over a single hub—detector polling interval (36 seconds by default hub settings). You can change the device polling interval in the **Jeweller** menu in the hub settings.

### **To start the test in the Ajax app:**

- **1.** Select the hub.
- **2.** Go to the **Devices** tab.
- **3.** Select **MultiTransmitter**.
- **4.** Go to **Settings** .
- **5.** Select a test:
	- Jeweller Signal Strength Test
	- Attenuation Test
- **6.** Start and run the test.

### Maintenance

Check the functionality of the integration module and the connected wired detectors and devices on a regular basis. The optimal interval for the check is once every three months. It is recommended to check that the wires are tightly fixed and connected to the terminals of the integration module.

Clean the casing from dust, cobwebs, and other contaminants as they emerge. Use a soft dry cloth that is suitable for equipment care. Do not use any substances containing alcohol, acetone, gasoline, and other active solvents to clean the device.
