# **3.3 Wiring**

![](_page_10_Picture_3.jpeg)

| 1 | 10-pin I/O connector.   | 2 | 2-pin 24V AC / 12-26V DC power input<br>connector. |
|---|-------------------------|---|----------------------------------------------------|
| 3 | RJ45 network connector. |   |                                                    |

### **3.3.1 Network and PoE power**

Connect the camera to a 10/100 Base-T network:

- Use STP Category 5e (or higher) cable with RJ45 connectors (the camera network socket is Auto MDIX compliant).
- Power can be supplied to the camera via the Ethernet cable compliant with the Powerover-Ethernet standard and/or via the 24V AC / 12-26V DC auxiliary power.

![](_page_10_Picture_9.jpeg)

### **Notice!**

Use only PoE approved devices.

Power-over-Ethernet (PoE) can be connected at the same time as a 24V AC / 12-26V DC power supply. If auxiliary power (24V AC / 12-26V DC) and PoE is applied simultaneously, the camera draws its power from PoE by default, and seamlessly switches to auxiliary input if PoE power fails.

When PoE power returns, the camera seamlessly switches back to PoE as its default power source.

### **3.3.2 24V AC / 12-26V DC power input**

Connect a SELV-LPS or a SELV Class 2 power supply with a rated supply voltage of 24V AC or 12-26V DC.

![](_page_11_Picture_6.jpeg)

### **Notice!**

When using a 24V AC power supply, do not make a ground connection with one of the 24V AC supply leads. This will damage the camera.

### **3.3.3 10-pin I/O connector**

| Pin | Connection  |
|-----|-------------|
| 1   | +12V DC out |
| 2   | GND         |
| 3   | ALARM OUT   |
| 4   | ALARM OUT   |
| 5   | GND         |
| 6   | ALARM IN 1  |
| 7   | ALARM IN 2  |
| 8   | GND         |
| 9   | AUDIO IN    |
| 10  | AUDIO OUT   |

### **12V DC power output**

The 12V DC output can be enabled/disabled via the web interface, and controlled via the Alarm Task Editor.

Maximum load of 50 mA.

### **Alarm I/O**

- 1. Input:
	- Use the alarm input to connect external alarm devices such as door contacts or sensors:
	- TTL logic, +5V nominal, +40V DC maximum, DC coupled with 50k Ohm pull-up to +3.3V.
	- Configurable as active low or active high.

Use a zero potential make-contact or switch as the actuator (with a bounce-free contact system).

- 2. Output:
Use the alarm output for switching external devices such as lamps or sirens. The alarm output switching capability has a maximum voltage of 30V AC or +40V DC; maximum 0.5 A continuous, 10 VA.

### **Audio I/O**

Connect audio devices to the audio input and audio output connectors. The unit has full-duplex mono audio for two-way communication between a speaker or door intercom system. The audio input signal is transmitted in synchronization with the video signal.

- 1. Input:
Line input level (not suitable for direct microphone signal); impedance 18 kOhm typical; 1 Vrms maximum input voltage.

- 2. Output:
Line output level (not suitable for direct speaker connection); impedance 1.5 kOhm minimum; 0.85 Vrms maximum output voltage.

Use shielded audio connection cable with advised maximum cable lengths for audio line input and output levels.

### **3.3.4 Grounding**

The camera is double-insulated and does not need a safety earth connection, but grounding is recommended for outdoor applications.

Grounding provides improved surge protection (up to 1 kV, 2 kA to ground (8/20 µs pulse)).

The grounding wire is not included in the box. Bosch recommends the use of a grounding wire with a ring terminal.

The ring terminal must not have a thickness greater than 2 mm (0.01 in.).

![](_page_12_Picture_14.jpeg)

### **Notice!**

Use proper surge protection on cables that are routed outdoors, or close to large inductive loads or electrical mains supply cables.

# **4 In-box configuration**

In-box configuration of the camera can be done via a wired or wireless connection with the camera still inside the box, by using a mobile device or PC.

- 1. Connect a network cable with PoE, and wait 1 minute for the camera to power up.
- 2. A Connect via wireless with the Project Assistant app by scanning the data matrix on the box label or the QR code on the identification label stickers, and apply the required configurations.

B - Connect and configure the camera via the wired network by using the web interface , the Project Assistant app or the Configuration Manager.

# **6 Commissioning**

With the FLEXIDOME IP starlight 8000i remote commissioning functionality, only a PC or a mobile device is needed to pan, tilt, roll, and zoom (PTRZ), and point the camera to the required field of view - without ever having to remove the camera from the box. Do the commissioning locally at the camera via WLAN using the Project Assistant app, available for iOS, Windows or Android, or by connecting remotely to the camera via the network using the Project Assistant app, the camera's web interface, or the Configuration Manager.

To commission the camera using the Project Assistant app:

- 1. Connect the network cable to the PoE.
- 2. Download the Project Assistant app.

![](_page_30_Picture_7.jpeg)

- 3. Do the necessary steps to configure the device. Use the step-by-step instructional video for help.
![](_page_30_Picture_10.jpeg)

If required, re-commissioning can be done at any time via WLAN, if not disabled, or via the network.

![](_page_30_Picture_12.jpeg)

### **Notice!**

The remote commissioning functionality (PTRZ) of the FLEXIDOME IP starlight 8000i and the WLAN mode of the camera are designed as installation aid for first set-up or adjustments at a later moment in time only.

![](_page_30_Picture_15.jpeg)

### **Notice!**

Remote commissioning can be done down to temperatures of -40º C / 104º F.

- **7 Connection via the web browser**
This device can be accessed via a web browser to configure, control, receive live images, and replay stored video.

For best experience, use Microsoft Internet Explorer browser with the Bosch MPEG-ActiveX plugin. This enables these functions:

- Native Bosch video decoder.
- Video analytics overlays.
- Video analytics configuration.
- Live Page: snapshot and record to PC.
- Status icon overlays.

Optionally, these tools can be used to configure the device:

- Project Assistant app: user friendly software to change basic device configurations and set fields of view. Available in iOS, Android, and Windows.
- Configuration Manager: advanced configuration software available for Windows. Download the software from https://downloadstore.boschsecurity.com.

# **7.1 System requirements**

The system recommendations are:

- Computer with Intel Skylake processor or better.
- Intel HD530 graphic card with performance that matches or is better than the resolution of the device.
- Windows 7 (or later) operating system.
- Network access.
- Internet Explorer version 11 or later

**- or -**

Application software: Video Security Client, Bosch Video Client, Bosch Video Management System or Project Assistant app.

# **7.2 Establishing the connection**

The device must have a valid IP address to operate on the network and a compatible subnet mask.

By default, DHCP is pre-set at the factory **On plus Link-Local** so a DHCP server assigns an IP address or, if no DHCP server is available, a link local address (auto-IP) is assigned within the range 169.254.1.0 to 169.254.254.255.

The IP Helper, Project Assistant app or Configuration Manager can be used to find the IP address. Download the software from https://downloadstore.boschsecurity.com:

- 1. Start the web browser.
- 2. Enter the IP address of the device as the URL.
- 3. During the initial installation, confirm any security questions that show.

If a RADIUS server is used for network access control (802.1x authentication), you must configure the device before the device can communicate with the network.

To configure the device, connect it directly to a computer using a network cable and then set the service-level password.

# **7.3 Password protection in camera**

The device is password-protected. The first time that any user accesses the device, the device will prompt the user to set a password at the service level.

The camera requires a strong password. Follow the prompts in the dialog box, which specifies what is required. The system measures the strength of the password that you enter.

When you use Configuration Manager to access your device for the first time, you must set the initial password of the device in Configuration Manager. The Users section (General > Unit Access > Users) displays the message, "Before you can use this device you have to secure it with an initial password."

**Note**: After you set the initial password, a "lock" icon appears next to the device name in the **Devices** list in Configuration Manager.

You can also launch the device webpage directly. In the device webpage, an initial password page appears, displaying input fields and a password strength gauge.

Enter the user name ("**service**") and a password in the appropriate fields. Refer to the section **User Management** for more information.

After a service-level password is set for the device, the device displays a dialog box that prompts users to enter the user name ("**service**") and the service-level password every time that they access the device.

- 1. Fill in the fields **User name** and **Password**.
- 2. Click **OK**. If the password is correct, the desired page appears.

**Note**: New releases of software may require you to set a new and stronger password.

# **8.2 Testing the network connection**

The ping command can be used to check the connection between two IP addresses. This allows testing whether a device is active in the network.

- 1. Open the DOS command prompt.
- 2. Type ping followed by the IP address of the device.

If the device is found, the response appears as "Reply from ... ", followed by the number of bytes sent and the transmission time in milliseconds. Otherwise, the device cannot be accessed via the network. This might be because:

- The device is not properly connected to the network. Check the cable connections in this case.
- The device is not correctly integrated into the network. Check the IP address, subnet mask, and gateway address.

# **8.3 Customer service**

If a fault cannot be resolved, please contact your supplier or system integrator, or go directly to Bosch Security Systems customer service.

The version numbers of the internal firmware can be viewed on a service page. Please note this information before contacting customer service.

- 1. In the address bar of your browser, after the unit IP address, enter: /version for example: 192.168.0.80/version
- 2. Write down the information or print out the page.

# **9 Maintenance**

There are different types of bubbles available to choose from. All bubbles require special care when handling and cleaning to avoid scratches.

# **9.1 Bubble handling**

The bubble may be packaged with a protective plastic sheet. It is recommended that the bubble remain stored this way until it is ready to install. Limit handling the bubble, as any scratches can quickly affect visibility.

# **9.2 Bubble cleaning**

If cleaning the bubble is required, use the following procedures and comply with all the warnings listed below.

### **Cleaning the bubble interior**

The extremely soft interior surface should not be cleaned by rubbing or dusting with a cloth. Use clean dry compressed air, preferably from a spray can, to remove any dust from the interior surface.

![](_page_36_Picture_10.jpeg)

### **Warning!**

Do not use alcohol-based solutions to clean the bubble. This will cause it to cloud and over time cause stress aging, which makes the bubble brittle.

### **Cleaning the bubble exterior**

The exterior of the bubble is hard coated for extra protection. If cleaning becomes necessary, only use cleaning solutions and cloths suitable for cleaning safety glass lenses. Dry the bubble thoroughly with a dry nonabrasive cloth to prevent water spots. Never scrub the bubble with any abrasive material or cleaners.

### **Cautions**

- Do not clean bubbles in the hot sun or on very hot days.
- Do not use abrasive or highly alkaline cleaners on the bubble.
- Do not scrape the bubble with razor blades or other sharp instruments.
- Do not use Benzene, Gasoline, Acetone, or Carbon Tetrachloride on the bubble.

### **9.3 Bubble replacement**

![](_page_36_Picture_21.jpeg)

**Notice!** Yellowing of bubble

Bubble may become yellow overtime due to exposure to UV radiation like direct or indirect sunlight.

In case the bubble gets damaged or yellow, it can be replaced by a clear bubble (NDA-8000- CBL) or a tinted bubble (NDA-8000-TBL).

Clear bubbles offer maximum sensitivity by allowing as much light through as possible. Tinted bubbles offer covertness by making it difficult to see from the outside the direction the camera is facing.

For instructions on how to replace the bubble, refer to the respective *Quick Installation Guide*.

### **9.4 Camera reset**

To reset the camera to factory settings:

- 1. Remove the camera module from the camera base.
- 2. Unscrew and remove the connection PCB from the camera base.

- 4. Connect a network cable with PoE or a 24V AC / 12-26V DC cable to power the camera module.
- 5. Press tightly and hold the reset button on top of the SD card slot for 15 seconds. The LED light by the reset button flashes in red.
- 6. Release the reset button.
- 7. Wait 60 seconds for the LED light to turn off and for the reset to be complete.
- 8. Remove the connection PCB from the camera module.
- 9. Disconnect the network or power cable from the camera module.
- 10. Re-install the connection PCB in the camera base.
- 11. Re-attach the camera module onto the camera base.
