# Operating principle

![](_page_2_Picture_9.jpeg)

FireProtect 2 (Heat/Smoke) is a wireless fire detector designed for indoor installation. Available in two modifications:

- With sealed batteries. Such a detector has **SB** in its name. Sealed battery life is 10 years. After the batteries are discharged, the detector should be replaced with a new one.
- With replaceable batteries. Such a detector has **RB** in its name. Pre-installed battery life is 7 years. When the batteries are discharged, they can be replaced with new ones.

## How to replace FireProtect 2 RB batteries (Heat/Smoke)

The detector is equipped with a siren (piezoelectric buzzer) for sound notification of alarms and events with a volume of up to 85 dB (at a distance of 3 m from the detector). The detector is always active and reacts to a fire during 24/7, regardless of the system's security mode.

FireProtect 2 is protected by two tampers. The first tamper controls the removal of the detector from the SmartBracket mounting panel: the detector reacts with LED indication and sends notifications to users in Ajax apps and the security company monitoring station. The second tamper signals the removal of the smoke chamber lid, which is located under the front panel of the detector.

> Removing the smoke chamber lid is possible when the enclosure is fully disassembled. The system detects this event as a malfunction. When the lid is removed, the detector reacts with a sound signal, and users and the security company receive a malfunction notification.

The can respond to FireProtect 2 alarms and perform user-defined actions using . For example, the relay can turn on the ventilation system and emergency lighting when an alarm occurs. Ajax automation devices automation scenarios WallSwitch

# Operation without a hub

FireProtect 2 can be used without connecting to the Ajax hub. All you need is to install the detector following this manual and turn it on.

In case of autonomous operation, the detector notifies of fire with a built-in siren and LED indication only and does not send notifications to the user's smartphone, Ajax Translator, or PRO Desktop. In this case, the feature is not available. Interconnected Fire Detectors Alarms

## Smoke sensor

FireProtect 2 detects smoke with a bispectral optical sensor. Inside the smoke chamber, the sensor has blue and infrared LEDs which emit light at different wavelengths. This technology allows the detector to determine the size of the

volatile particles inside the chamber and respond only to smoke, ignoring vapour and steam.

The smoke chamber in FireProtect 2 is protected from dust, dirt, and insects. Even if dust gets inside and settles, this does not threaten or impair fire detection. The optical system is designed to prevent non-volatile particles from getting within the field of both blue and infrared LEDs at the same time. So that situation does not cause a false alarm.

The HazeFlow 2 software algorithm also protects against false alarms. When an alarm is detected, the algorithm additionally processes the data received from the detector and confirms the alarm.

## Temperature sensor

Two built-in class A1 thermistors detect a rapid rise and exceeding the temperature threshold in FireProtect 2. The thermistors of this class notify of alarms when a rapid temperature rise or static temperature is detected in the range of +54°C to +65°C.

The thermistors are mounted outside under the front panel of the detector. This allows you to respond to threats faster than when the sensors are inside the detector enclosure.

FireProtect 2 will reports that the temperature threshold has been exceeded as soon as its value exceeds +64°C. The detector will reports a rapid temperature rise if the indicator increases by 10°C within one minute. If the temperature indicator rises sharply by 20°C or more, the detector signals immediately.

## Test/Mute button

The Test/Mute button is located under the front panel of the detector. This is a mechanical button. Тo activate it, press lightly on the central part of the front panel with your hand or a suitable item if the detector is installed in a hard-toreach place. For example, you can do this with a mop handle.

The button performs several functions:

- In normal mode, it starts the detector self-test.
- In case of an alarm, it mutes the detector alarm or of all fire detectors in the system. Interconnected Alarm
## Interconnected Fire Detectors Alarms

All fire detectors of the FireProtect 2 product line support the Interconnected Alarm feature. This feature activates the built-in sirens of all fire detectors in the system as soon as at least one of the fire detectors has detected an alarm. Sirens of FireProtect 2 detectors are activated within 20 seconds after an alarm is detected. The sirens of and are activated during the detector ping interval set in the **Jeweller** (or **Jeweller/Fibra)** settings, but no later than 60 seconds after. FireProtect FireProtect Plus

The detectors have different sound and LED indications of alarm types to make it easier for users to distinguish between them. In case of interconnected alarm, all FireProtect 2 detectors indicate exactly the alarm type detected by the initiating detector. Instead, and detectors notifies all types of alarms with the same sound. FireProtect 2 FireProtect FireProtect Plus

#### How to set Interconnected Fire Detectors Alarms

## Sending events to the monitoring station

The Ajax security system can transmit events and alarms to the monitoring app as well as the Central Monitoring Station (CMS) via **SurGard (Contact ID), SIA DC-09 (ADM-CID), ADEMCO 685**, and other protocols. The list of supported protocols is . PRO Desktop available here

## Which CMSs Ajax connects to

Addressability of Ajax devices allows you to send to the PRO Desktop and to the CMS not only events but also the type of the device, the name given to it, virtual room, and security group. The list of transmitted parameters may differ depending on the CMS type and the selected communication protocol.

## Adding to the system

## Before adding a device

- **1.** Install the Ajax app.
- **2.** Create an account if you don't have one.
- **3.** Add a to the app. Set the required settings and create at least one . hub compatible with the detector virtual room
- **4.** Make sure that the hub is on and has Internet access via Ethernet, Wi-Fi, and/or mobile network. You can do this in the Ajax app or by looking at the LED indicator of the hub: it should light up white or green.
- **5.** Make sure that the hub does not start updates and that it is disarmed by checking the status in the Ajax app.

To connect to the hub, the detector should be within the coverage area of the hub radio network. To operate via a , first connect the detector to the hub and then to the range extender. You can do this in the range extender settings in Ajax apps. radio signal range extender

## How to connect FireProtect 2 to a hub

- **1.** Open the Ajax app.
- **2.** Select the hub if you have several of them or if you are using the . Ajax PRO app
- **3.** Go to the **Devices** tab. Press **Add Device**.
- **4.** Enter the name of the device.
- **5.** Scan the QR code or enter the ID manually. QR code is located on the rear part of the enclosure (under the mounting panel) and on the device packaging. The device ID can be found below the QR code.
- **6.** Select the virtual room and security group (if the group mode is enabled).
- **7.** Click **Add**; the countdown will begin.

If the maximum number of devices is added to the hub, when adding the one, you will get a notification of exceeding the device limit. The number of devices that you can connect to the hub depends on the central unit model.

- **8.** Turn on the detector by holding the power button for 3 seconds. The hub connection request is sent only if the detector is enabled. If the detector fails to connect to the hub, try again in 5 seconds.
The detector cannot connect to the hub if they operate on different radio frequencies. The radio frequency range of the devices may vary by the region of sale. Please contact for information on the operating frequency range of your devices. technical support

Once connected, FireProtect 2 will appear in the hub device list in the Ajax app. Device status update depends on the ping interval set in the **Jeweller** or **Jeweller/Fibra** settings. The default value is 36 seconds.

FireProtect 2 works with only one hub. When connected to a new hub, the detector stops transmitting data to the old hub. Once added to a new hub, FireProtect 2 is not removed from the list of devices of the old hub. This must be done manually in Ajax apps.

## Detector testing

## Functionality testing

The test allows you to check the status of the detector's sensors. You can run it in two ways: by pressing the detector Test/Mute button and in Ajax apps.

If the detector is in an alarm state, the self-test is not available.

**To run the test using the Test/Mute button**, press the center of the detector front panel and hold it for 1.5 seconds.

#### **To run the test in the Ajax app:**

- **1.** Open the Ajax app.
- **2.** Select the hub if you have several of them or if you are using the . Ajax PRO app
- **3.** Go to the **Devices** menu.
- **4.** Select **FireProtect 2 (Heat/Smoke)**.
- **5.** Go to the settings by clicking on the gear icon .
- **6.** Click on the **Device Self-test** field.

After starting the test, the red LED of the detector blinks 5 times in a row and then blinks 3 more times but slower. The detector's siren beeps in time with an LED indication. When the test is over, users receive a notification of the detector state in Ajax apps.

The detector also notifies of the test result with sound and LED indications. If the test is failed and a malfunction is detected, 3 seconds after the start of the test, the detector starts the indication **Malfunction detected**: the yellow LED blinks twice, the siren beeps two times in time with the LED indication.

If there were no sound and LED indications during the self-test, the detector cannot be used. Contact our . Technical Support

# Testing at the place of installation

Ajax security system provides several tests to select the correct installation place of devices. **Jeweller Signal Strength Test** is available for FireProtect 2. The test determines the strength and stability of the signal at the intended location of the device.

#### **To run the test in the Ajax app:**

- **1.** Select the hub if you have several of them or if you are using the . Ajax PRO app
- **2.** Go to the **Devices** menu.
- **3.** Select **FireProtect 2 (Heat/Smoke)**.
- **4.** Go to the settings by clicking on the gear icon .
- **5.** Select **Jeweller Signal Strength Test**.
- **6.** Perform the test following the tips in the app.

## Selection of installation place

![](_page_20_Picture_0.jpeg)

The coverage area of one FireProtect 2 (Heat/Smoke) is 50 to 60 m², depending on the type of premises.

The detector should be installed in every room. The detector is placed in the center of the ceiling at a distance of 30 cm from light fixtures, chandeliers, or any other decorative objects that may interfere with alarm detection.

If there are beams on the ceiling protruding 30 cm or more, then the detector must be installed between every two such beams. If the beams protrude by less than 30 cm, installation on a beam in the central part of the ceiling is allowed.

In halls or narrow corridors, detectors should be installed at a distance of no more than 7.5 m from each other.

If the ceiling is sloping, the detector is installed at a distance of 60 cm from the top point of the ceiling. To select an installation place, draw a straight line down from the top of the ceiling. Then, draw a perpendicular from this line to the sloping part of the ceiling. The detector is installed at this point.

![](_page_20_Picture_7.jpeg)

We do not recommend mounting the detector on a wall. This installation is acceptable if closely spaced beams or other obstacles interfere with the installation of the detector. Wall mounting is possible only if the detector is placed at a distance of 15–30 cm below the ceiling but above the doorways. When choosing location of the detector, consider the parameters that affect its operation:

- Jeweller signal strength.
- Distance between the detector and the hub.
- Presence of barriers for radio signal passage between devices: floor slabs, walls, interfloor ceilings, large objects located in the premise.

Consider the placement recommendations when designing the project of Ajax security system for the object. The security system must be designed and installed by specialists. The list of recommended partners is . available here

# Signal strength

The Jeweller signal strength is determined by the ratio of the number of undelivered or corrupted data packets that are exchanged between the hub and the detector to expected ones within a certain period of time. Signal strength is indicated by the icon on the **Devices** tab:

- **Three bars** excellent signal strength.
- **Two bars** good signal strength.
- **One bar** low signal strength; stable operation is not guaranteed.
- **Crossed out icon** no signal; stable operation is not guaranteed.

Check the Jeweller signal strength at the installation place. If the signal strength is as low as one or zero bars, we cannot guarantee stable operation of the device. In this case, move the device. Repositioning even by 20 cm can significantly improve the signal reception.

If after relocation the detector still has a low or unstable signal strength, use a . radio signal range extender

## Do not install the detector:

- **1.** Outdoors. This can lead to the detector failure.
- **2.** In places with low or unstable Jeweller signal strength. This can result the connection loss.
- **3.** Inside premises with temperature and humidity outside the permissible limits. This could damage the detector.
- **4.** In places with fast air circulation. For example, near fans, vents, open windows, or doors. This may interfere with fire detection.
- **5.** Opposite any objects with rapidly changing temperature. For example, electric and gas heaters. This can lead to false alarms.
- **6.** In the corners of the room. This may interfere with fire detection.
- **7.** In bathrooms, showers, or other areas where the temperature changes rapidly. This can lead to false alarms.
- **8.** In premises where the generation of gases/vapours/smoke is part of the operating process. For example, in a garage, where the possibility of a detector's alarm due to vehicle exhaust gases exists. For such premises, we recommend using a detector without a smoke sensor: . FireProtect 2 (Heat/CO)
- **9.** In very dusty areas or places with a lot of insects. Insects, dust, and other contaminants can settle on the smoke chamber lid and prevent fire detection.
- **10.** Near lighting fixtures, decorations, and other interior items that may interfere with the circulation of air in the premise. This may interfere with fire detection.
- **11.** On surfaces that are usually warmer or colder than the rest of the premise. For example, roof traps. Temperature fluctuations can interfere with fire detection.
- **12.** In high or inconvenient places. Access to the Test/Mute button is required to mute the alarm and test the detector if it's used without connection to a hub.

# Installation

![](_page_22_Picture_12.jpeg)

#### **To install the detector:**

- **1.** Remove the SmartBracket mounting panel from the detector. To remove the panel, turn it counterclockwise.
- **2.** Fix the SmartBracket mounting panel to a surface using double-sided adhesive tape or other temporary fasteners. The mounting panel has the UP sign, which indicates the correct position.

![](_page_23_Picture_3.jpeg)

Use double-sided adhesive tape for temporary fixation only. The device fixed by the adhesive tape can peel off the surface at any time, which can lead to damage if the device is dropped.

- **3.** Run the Signal Strength Test. The recommended value is two or three bars. Jeweller
If the signal strength is a single bar or lower, we cannot guarantee the stable operation of the detector. Consider to relocate the device as repositioning even by 20 cm can significantly improve the signal strength. If there is still low or unstable signal after the relocation, use a . radio signal range extender

- **4.** Remove the detector from the mounting panel.
- **5.** Attach the SmartBracket panel with the bundled screws using all fixation points. When using other fasteners, make sure they do not damage or deform the mounting panel.
- **6.** Place the detector on the SmartBracket mounting panel.
- **7.** Adjust the position of the detector if necessary.

It is necessary to perform a after the installation is finished. Self-test

## Malfunctions

![](_page_24_Picture_0.jpeg)

If FireProtect 2 malfunction is detected (for example, there is no connection with the hub), the malfunction counter is displayed in the device field in the Ajax apps.

All malfunctions are displayed in the detector . Fields with malfunctions are highlighted in red. States

The device can report malfunctions to the CMS, as well as to users through push notifications and SMS.

#### **FireProtect 2 (Heat/Smoke) malfunctions:**

- There is no connection with the hub or radio signal range extender.
- The detector's enclosure is open.
- Low battery charge level.
- The device service life has expired.
- Hardware malfunction (failure of one or more sensors of the detector).

## Maintenance

The detector has a self-test system and does not require the user or installer intervention. The smoke chamber is protected from dust and insects, so there is no need to clean it. We recommend running a periodically to familiarize people with the alarm sound and LED indication. self-test

Clean the detector enclosure of dust, cobwebs, and other contaminants as they appear. Use a soft dry cloth suitable for equipment care. Do not use substances that contain alcohol, acetone, gasoline, and other active solvents.

The service life of the detector is 10 years. After this period, the sensitivity of the sensors decreases. We recommend replacing the detector with a new one to ensure uninterrupted fire protection at the premises.

The version of the detector with replaceable batteries (has **RB** in the name) operates from pre-installed to detector batteries for up to 7 years. When the batteries are discharged, replace them with new ones.

#### How to replace FireProtect 2 RB batteries (Heat/Smoke)

A detector with sealed batteries (has **SB** in the name) should be replaced with a new one after the batteries are discharged.
