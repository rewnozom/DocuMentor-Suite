#### How to replace FireProtect 2 RB (CO) batteries

The detector is equipped with a siren (piezoelectric buzzer) for audible notification of alarms and events with a volume of up to 85 dB (at a distance of 3 m from the detector). The detector is always active and reacts to a fire 24/7, regardless of the system's security mode.

FireProtect 2 is protected by . The tamper controls the removal of the detector from the SmartBracket mounting panel: the detector reacts with LED indication and sends notifications to users in Ajax apps and the CMS. tamper

# CO (carbon monoxide) sensor

FireProtect 2 has a chemical sensor which detects dangerous levels of carbon monoxide. The operation principle of the sensor is based on a chemical reaction. There is an electrolyte bath inside the sensor. When a specific level of carbon monoxide is reached, a chemical reaction is triggered. The detector reads this event and transforms it into an alarm.

The detector raises an alarm if the CO level reaches:

- 50 ppm (0.005%) and above in no more than 90 minutes.
- 100 ppm (0.01%) and above in no more than 40 minutes.
- 300 ppm (0.03%) and above in no more than 3 minutes.

A CO concentration of 400 ppm (0.04%) for three hours is life-threatening. The detector stops warning of a dangerous carbon monoxide level as soon as the concentration drops to 40 ppm (0.004%).

# Test/Mute button

Тo activate the **Test/Mute** button, press lightly on the centre of the front panel with your hand. Use a suitable item (mop handle) if you can't reach up the detector with your hand. **Test/Mute** is a mechanical button placed under the front panel of the detector.

The button performs several functions:

- In normal mode, it starts the detector self-test.
- In case of an alarm, it mutes the detector alarm or of all fire detectors in the systemfor 10 minutes. Interconnected Alarm

## Interconnected Fire Detectors Alarms*

All fire detectors of the FireProtect 2 product line support the Interconnected Alarm feature. This feature activates the built-in sirens of all fire detectors in the system as soon as at least one of the fire detectors detects an alarm. Sirens of FireProtect 2 detectors are activated within 20 seconds after an alarm is detected. and are activated over a detector ping interval set in the **Jeweller** or **Jeweller/Fibra** settings, but no later than in 60 seconds. FireProtect FireProtect Plus

The detectors have different sound and LED indications of alarm types to make it easier for users to distinguish between them. In case of interconnected alarm, all FireProtect 2 detectors indicate exactly the alarm type detected by the initiating detector. Instead, and detectors notify all types of alarms with the same sound. FireProtect 2 FireProtect FireProtect Plus

*The Interconnected Fire Detectors Alarm function is not certified according to EN 14604 and EN 50291.

## Detector testing

# Functionality testing

The test allows you to check the status of the detector's sensors. You can run it in two ways: by pressing the **Test/Mute button** of the detector and in Ajax apps.

![](_page_11_Picture_0.jpeg)

**To run the test using the Test/Mute button**, press the center of the front panel and hold it for 1.5 seconds.

#### **To run the test in the Ajax app:**

- **1.** Open the Ajax app.
- **2.** Select the hub if you have several of them or if you are using the . Ajax PRO app
- **3.** Go to the **Devices** menu.
- **4.** Select **FireProtect 2 RB (CO)**.
- **5.** Go to the settings by clicking on the gear icon .
- **6.** Click on the **Device Self-test** field.

After starting the test, the red LED of the detector flashes 5 times in a row and then flashes 3 more times but slower. The detector's siren beeps in time with an LED indication. When the test is over, users receive a notification about the detector state in Ajax apps.

The detector also notifies about the test result with sound and LED indications. If the test is failed and a malfunction is detected, the detector starts **to indicate a malfunction** 3 seconds after the test is begun: the yellow LED flashes twice, and the siren beeps in time with the LED indication.

The self-test does not start immediately, but no later than 30 seconds after pressing the test button or running from the Ajax app.

If no sound and LED indications occurred during the self-test, the detector may not be used. Contact our . Technical Support

# Testing at the place of installation

Ajax system provides several tests to select the correct installation place of devices. **Jeweller Signal Strength Test** is available for FireProtect 2. The test determines the strength and stability of the signal at the intended location of the device.

#### **To run the test in the Ajax app:**

- **1.** Select the hub if you have several of them or if you are using the . Ajax PRO app
- **2.** Go to the **Devices** menu.
- **3.** Select **FireProtect 2 RB (CO)**.
- **4.** Go to the settings by clicking on the gear icon .
- **5.** Select **Jeweller Signal Strength Test**.
- **6.** Perform the test following the tips in the app

The test does not start immediately, but the waiting time does not exceed the duration of one detector ping interval. The default value is 36 seconds. You can change the detector ping interval in the **Jeweller** (or **Jeweller/Fibra**) menu in the hub settings.

# Icons

The icons show some of the detector states. You can view them in Ajax apps in the **Devices** tab.

This feature doesn't affect alarm notification delivery time.

To disable the **Battery Life Optimization** feature:

- Open the Ajax app.
- Select the hub with FireProtect 2 detectors connected.
- Go to: **Hub** → **Settings** → **Service** → **Fire Detectors Settings.**
- Disable the **Battery Life Optimization** toggle**.**
- Click **Back** to save the settings.

If the **Battery Life Optimization** feature is disabled **FireProtect 2 RB (Heat/CO)** battery life is 3.5 years (instead of 7).

# Selection of installation place

![](_page_19_Picture_5.jpeg)

The coverage area of one FireProtect 2 RB (CO) is 50 to 60 m², depending on the type of premises. The detector should be installed in every room. The detector is suitable for installation in premises where the generation of gases/vapors/smoke is part of the operating process. For example, in a garage, kitchen, or boiler room.

The detector mounts on the wall at a height of 1.5 m from the floor. As an alternative it can be mounted on the ceiling. The detector must be placed at a distance of 30 cm from light fixtures, chandeliers, or any other decorative objects that may interfere with alarm detection.

In halls or narrow corridors, detectors should be installed at a distance of no more than 7.5 m from each other.

![](_page_19_Picture_9.jpeg)

When installing on the wall, ensure the LEDs are visible to the user. It means FireProtect 2 must be installed upside down.

When choosing the location of the detector, consider the parameters that affect its operation:

- Jeweller signal strength.
- Distance between the detector and the hub.

- Presence of barriers for radio signal passage between devices: walls, interfloor ceilings, large objects located in the premises.
Consider the placement recommendations when designing your Ajax system for the object. The security system must be designed and installed by specialists. The list of recommended partners is . available here

# Signal strength

The Jeweller signal strength is determined by the ratio of the number of undelivered/corrupted data packets that are exchanged between the hub and the detector to expected ones within a certain period of time. Signal strength is indicated by the icon on the **Devices** tab:

- **Three bars** excellent signal strength.
- **Two bars** good signal strength.
- **One bar** low signal strength; stable operation is not guaranteed.
- **Crossed out icon** no signal; stable operation is not guaranteed.

Check the Jeweller signal strength at the installation site. If the signal strength is as low as one or zero bars, we cannot guarantee stable operation of the device. In this case, move the device. Repositioning even by 20 cm can significantly improve the signal reception.

If, after relocation, the detector still has a low or unstable signal strength, use a . radio signal range extender

## Do not install the detector

- **1.** Outdoors. This can lead to the detector failure.
- **2.** In places with low or unstable Jeweller signal strength. This can result in the connection loss.
- **3.** Inside premises with temperature and humidity outside the permissible limits. This could damage the detector.
- **4.** In places with fast air circulation. For example, near fans, vents, open windows, or doors. This can lead to false alarms.
- **5.** In the corners of the room. This can lead to false alarms.
- **6.** Near lighting fixtures, decorations, and other interior items that may interfere with the circulation of air in the room. This could lead to false alarms.
- **7.** Closer than 1–1.5 meters to an open flame source. For example, near a fireplace, grill, or kitchen stove. This can lead to false alarms.
- **8.** In high or inconvenient places. Access to the Test/Mute button is required to mute the alarm and test the detector if it's used without connection to a hub.

# Installation

![](_page_21_Picture_6.jpeg)

![](_page_21_Picture_7.jpeg)

Only a competent specialist should install this device.

#### **To install the detector:**

- **1.** Remove the SmartBracket mounting panel from the detector. To remove the panel, turn it counterclockwise.
- **2.** Fix the SmartBracket mounting panel to a surface using double-sided adhesive tape or other temporary fasteners. The mounting panel has an UP sign, which indicates the correct position.

![](_page_21_Picture_12.jpeg)

Use double-sided adhesive tape for temporary fixation only. The device fixed by the adhesive tape can peel off the surface at any time, which can lead to damage if the device is dropped.

- **3.** Run the . The recommended value is two or three bars. Jeweller Signal Strength Test
Consider to relocate the device as repositioning even by 20 cm can significantly improve the signal strength. If there is still low or unstable signal after the relocation, use a . radio signal range extender

- **4.** Remove the detector from the mounting panel.
- **5.** Attach the SmartBracket panel with the bundled screws using all fixation points. When using other fasteners, make sure they do not damage or deform the mounting panel.
- **6.** Place the detector on the SmartBracket mounting panel.
- **7.** Adjust the position of the detector if necessary.

# Actions to take in case of CO alarm

- **1.** Immediately open all the doors and windows to ventilate the premises if it is safe.
**NEVER IGNORE THE ALARM!** When you open the doors and windows for ventilation, the CO level can drop to acceptable, and the alarm may have stopped by the time help arrives. The solution to the problem may be temporary. You have to determine the CO source and make a repair.

- **2.** Stop using and turn off all fuel devices where it is possible.
- **3.** Evacuate from the premises leaving the doors and windows open.

**WARNING:** If you hear the CO alarm, it has detected dangerous levels of carbon monoxide. Always evacuate from the premises, even if you are unsure about the cause of a CO alarm.

- **4.** If you have a headache and nausea, get medical help immediately. These could be the result of carbon monoxide poisoning, so tell your doctor about it.
- **5.** Call your gas or other fuel supplier's hotline. Keep the number in a noticeable place.
- **6.** Avoid re-entering the premises until the alarm stops.

If the alarm was silenced by the **Test/Mute button** (for CO level under 300 ppm), check the CO level at the Ajax app. If it is safe to enter the premises, press the Test/Mute button again to check the CO level.

Any remote silencing feature (e.g., via Ajax app) shall only be used in the line of sight of the CO siren.

- **7.** Do not use the fuel or gas appliances again until registered installers or experts have checked them.
## Carbon monoxide impact

Carbon monoxide poisoning occurs regularly: many people are killed each year, and many more suffer ill health. CO is an invisible, odorless, tasteless, and extremely toxic gas. CO is produced by burning such fuels as petrol, diesel, coal, oil, natural/bottled gas, paraffin, wood, charcoal, etc. The heart and brain are rapidly damaged by oxygen starvation because red blood cells in the lungs absorb CO faster than oxygen.

The most common reasons for high levels of CO in premises:

- Engines of cars, generators, etc., are left running in confined spaces (for example, a garage).
- Incorrectly or poorly installed fuel-burning appliances.
- Blocked or damaged vents or chimneys/flues.
- The tightness of rooms where appliances for burning fuel or fireplaces are installed.
- Bad ventilation in rooms with portable gas/paraffin heaters.

**IMPORTANT:** A CO alarm should not be used as a substitute for proper installation, use, and maintenance of fuel-burning appliances, including appropriate ventilation and exhaust systems.

The CO exposure period is also important. A low level for a long period (e.g., 150 ppm for 90 minutes) can cause the same symptoms as a high level of CO for a short period (e.g., 300 ppm CO for 30 minutes). The table below shows how different concentrations of CO affect people.

![](_page_24_Picture_4.jpeg)

FireProtect 2 may not prevent the chronic effects of carbon monoxide exposure and will not fully protect people from the high-risk group.

Even if people realize they are not well, they become so disoriented by the carbon monoxide that they cannot call for help or get out of the room to save their lives. Numerous cases of carbon monoxide poisoning show that children and household pets are affected first.

# Malfunctions

![](_page_25_Picture_4.jpeg)

If FireProtect 2 malfunction is detected (for example, there is no connection with the hub), the malfunction counter is displayed in the device field in the Ajax apps.

All malfunctions are displayed in the detector . Fields with malfunctions are highlighted in red. States

The device can report malfunctions to the CMS, as well as to users through push notifications and SMS.

#### **FireProtect 2 RB (CO) malfunctions:**

- No connection with the hub or radio signal range extender.
- The detector's enclosure is open.
- Low battery charge level.
- The device service life has expired.
- Hardware malfunction (failure of one or more sensors of the detector).

# Maintenance

The detector has a system and does not require the user or installer intervention. We recommend running a self-test periodically to familiarize people with the alarm sound and LED indication. self-test

FireProtect 2 devices connected to the Ajax hubs generally do not require routine testing. All connected devices are constantly monitored for possible Faults, Low battery, and EOL signals.

However, we encourage all users to test FireProtect 2 devices periodically (monthly)* to allow residents of the building to become familiar with the fire alarm signals of the system.

*Please be aware that your local regulation might require more frequent testing (e.g., weekly).

Clean the detector enclosure of dust, cobwebs, and other contaminants as they emerge. Use a soft dry cloth suitable for equipment care. Do not use substances that contain alcohol, acetone, gasoline, and other active solvents.

The service life of the detector is 10 years. After this period, the sensitivity of the sensors decreases. We recommend replacing the detector with a new one to ensure uninterrupted fire protection at the premises.

The detector operates from pre-installed batteries for up to 7 years. When the batteries are discharged, replace them with new ones.
