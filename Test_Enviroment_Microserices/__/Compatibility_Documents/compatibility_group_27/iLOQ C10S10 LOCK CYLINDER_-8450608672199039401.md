### Features

The patented, award winning iLOQ S10 locking system offers advanced security and convenient access management for master-key locking environments.

The unique self-powered iLOQ C10.1 lock cylinder is powered by harvesting electricity from inserting of the iLOQ K10S.1 key. Being self-powered, the iLOQ C10S cylinder eliminates work, costs, wastes and harms associated with battery powered or cabled solutions. As no batteries or electric wiring are required, the locks and keys are easy to install and maintain, and it is an environmentally friendly "green" solution. The communication between the lock and the iLOQ K10S.1 key is strongly encrypted using standardized powerful SHA-1 encryption methods. The mechanically identical shape of the iLOQ C10S cylinders enables flexible stocking and fast delivery. Mechanical and electronic strength are compliant with international standards.

The lock cylinder is programmed at the installation site using a mobile phone or computer and iLOQ P10S programming device. A key is erased upon return. The lock can also be erased, and both may be reused, for instance in another locking system. An electronic key cannot be duplicated, and lost keys are easily blacklisted using programming device. This maintains a high level of security and ensures a long lifecycle for the security solution. The lock cylinder records audit trail of lock events.

#### Operation

To operate the lock, insert the key entirely into the keyway and turn the key. If the lock does not open, remove the key and re-insert it into the lock, this time more slowly.

The electric energy is harvested for lock operations when the key is inserted into the lock. If the movement is too fast the lock is kept in the locked state. Do not use force when inserting a key into the lock.

The contact wire on the metal part of the key must be clean and smooth. If the contact wire is dirty, wipe it clean using a soft tissue. Replace the key if the contact wire is damaged.
