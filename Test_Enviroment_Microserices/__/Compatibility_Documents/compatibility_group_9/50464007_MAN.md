# **6** POSITIONING AND INSTALLATION

Please observe the following instructions and read the entire manual carefully for installing BAT 300 Tempest Technology: Request to UR Fog or its distributors to take part in courses for installers to ensure the optimal installation of the equipment.

- The device must be installed avoiding to obstruct escape routes. (according to EN50131-8:2019)
- Verify the fog does not limit the visibility near: stairs, landings, moving objects that may cause falls, injuries or any damage to persons
- When using the product in multi-storey buildings, if the escape route runs through an area which is protected by a fogging system, it is recommended to install a vocal warning that provides instructions on the behavior to observe.
- Never direct the fog jet towards an object or a wall less than 2 meters away
- Avoid installing the UR Fog device in front of obstacles that could cause the deflection or blocking of the fog jet, thus preventing its correct diffusion
- Be careful to shoot directly against the windows and doors, as in the event of their breakthrough, the fog tends to escape easily. If these remain open or are uprooted upon intrusion, there is a risk of directing the fog outside the premises
- The dead zone is the wall on which the fog generator is installed. This area will be the last to be saturated as the fog must encounter obstacles to be able to go back. The ceiling dead zone is normally negligible
- Remember that, depending on the models, the fog jet of the UR Fog devices after the first 3 seconds of delivery can exceed 10 meters from the point where the device is installed
- Setting the shooting time interval between the minimum and maximum shown in the shooting table, avoid "overshooting" even if the produced fog is dry and generally doesn't leave residue. A shot that goes far beyond the recommended seconds can create a residue problems in the protected room
- Install the device at the heights provided for each model by the manufacturer
- Install the systems so that, when the alarm is not activated, they cannot be tampered, for example by occluding the fog emission nozzle
- Don't activate the UR Fog device before the installation is completed. Insert the refill as the last operation following the procedure described in the manual. It is advisable to perform the first activation test keeping the refill disconnected.
- When the installation is finished, always test the system
- When carrying out functional tests of the UR Fog device, remember to notify the local Fire Brigade in advance, in order to prevent false alarms
- Remember to put warning labels about the presence of UR Fog on the windows or to the access points to the protected area
- Report its installation to the firefighters in your area and eventually to other institutions if needed. Use the notification to the authorities document included in the package

### Choose the surface

For a correct installation, identify a surface (shelf, wall, ceiling or other) that guarantees a safe seal. Use screws, anchors and other restraint systems suitable for the purpose and for the surface.

For wall installation use the orientable bracket to direct the fog downwards (see chapter 19). The fixing holes of the wall bracket are the same of the BAT 300 Tempest Technology.

By properly setting some jumpers on the pcb, the TEMPEST BAT 300 device can be set to work in one of six possible modes as described below.

ATTENTION: all jumpers must be inserted / removed ONLY with the device turned off for both low-power and always-on modes.

### 9.1 Mode 1: Low power mode / No supply voltage applied

#### *Configuration: W3 open, J11 pin 1-2 not connected*

In this mode the device operates fully disconnected by the mains supply. With new and fully charged batteries TEMPEST is able to work for at least 6 months while still being able to make a full time shot with the remaining charge. The serial interface is disabled so no network connection is possible.

### 9.2 Mode 2: Low power mode / Supply voltage applied / Slow charging mode

#### *Configuration: W3 open, W8 open, J11 pin 1-2 with supply voltage 10-16V, min 350 mA*

In slow charging mode the internal battery charger is enabled and it takes roughly 20 h to completely recover the energy lost in a full time shot (60 s).

The serial interface is disabled so no network connection is possible.

### 9.3 Mode 3: Low power mode / Supply voltage applied / Fast charging mode

#### *Configuration: W3 open, W8 closed, J11 pin 1-2 with supply voltage 10-16V, min 1.0 A*

In fast charging mode the internal battery charger is enabled and it takes roughly 6 h to completely recover the energy lost in a full time shot (60 s).

The serial interface is disabled so no network connection is possible.

### 9.4 Mode 4: Always-on / No supply voltage applied

### *Configuration: W3 closed, J11 pin 1-2 not connected*

In always-on mode the electronic board has all its subsystems always powered on. With new and fully charged batteries TEMPEST is be able to work for at least 4-5 days, and around 2 days with an Active Cloud board. The serial port is enabled and fully working so an Active Cloud board can be connected and the device can be accessed from remote locations. A 24V 12V DC/DC converter is necessary to supply the Active Cloud board (or any other piece of equipment that requires +12 V DC, as is usual in the security field).

### 9.5 Mode 5: Always-on / Supply voltage applied / Slow charging mode

### *Configuration: W3 closed, W8 open, J11 pin 1-2 with supply voltage 10-16V, min. 350 mA*

In always-on mode the electronic board has all of its subsystems always powered on. In Slow charging mode the internal battery charger is enabled and it takes up to 3 days to completely recover the energy lost in a full time shot (60 s). The serial port is enabled and fully working so an Active Cloud board can be connected and the device can be accessed from remote locations BUT NO POWER can be drawn from the device so any add-on board, including the Active Cloud board, must be powered from an external source, preferably from the alarm control unit with backup battery in the event of a 230V mains power failure.

### 9.6 Mode 6: Always-on / Supply voltage applied / Fast charging mode

### *Configuration: W3 closed, W8 closed, J11 pin 1-2 with supply voltage 10-16V, min. 1.0 A*

In always-on mode the electronic board has all of its subsystems always powered on. In Fast charging mode the internal battery charger is enabled and it takes up to 8 hours to completely recover the energy lost in a full time shot (60 s). With the Active Cloud board connected the time raises to around 10 hours.

The serial port is enabled and fully working so an Active Cloud board can be connected and the device can be accessed from remote locations. A 24V->12V DC/DC converter is necessary to supply the cloud board (or any other piece of equipment that requires +12 V DC, as is usual in the security field).

## 9.7 Summary tables

The following tables constitute a useful reference to correctly identify and choose the best connection method. The estimated on-time is calculated taken into account a couple of brand new and fully charged original batteries. The impact of a low power PIR sensor connected and powered by the device is also evaluated (not significant).

# 10.2 Connection to the alarm panel

BAT 300 Tempest Technology can be connected to an alarm panel in the same way as other models of the UR Fog range. It can be also driven by the serial interface (i.e., with an Active Cloud Board).

## 10.3 Inputs connection

The ON/OFF output of this alarm panel is an NPN Open collector open when the system is OFF, which closes permanently to ground (GND) for as long as the same remains in ON. This output is connected to the pin 7 "ARM".

![](_page_12_Picture_2.jpeg)

### PIR/Panic input

Input 9 can be defined as PIR verification or Panic by adding a jumper across W5. W5 closed: PIR input W5 open: PANIC button. This is an open collector input. (Dry contact to Gnd).

#### PIR input mode

With W5 closed, the jumper W6 defines the function of the PIR input. W6 closed: TRIG validation W6 open: stand alone shooting command

## 10.4 Outputs connection

#### The EMPTY FLUID

(NPN Open collector 50mA max) output closes to ground (GND) when the fluid cartridge is empty or in reserve (one shoot still available).

The FAULT

(NPN Open collector 50mA max) output closes to ground (GND) when is a malfunction.

The LOW BATTERY (NPN Open collector 50mA max) output closes to ground (GND) when batteries are low.

![](_page_12_Figure_13.jpeg)

# **11** SHOOTING TIME PROGRAMMING

There are four possible configurations to program the shooting time via the S1 dipswitch. The dipswitch can be set before any shot and there is no need to power cycle the device to set the shooting time.

![](_page_13_Picture_2.jpeg)

Note: After a shot the processor introduces a cooling time during which any subsequent shot is not allowed until after a specific time has elapsed: 2 s shot – 1 min delay 15 s shot – 5 min delay 30 s shot - 10 min delay 60 s shot - 20 min delay

The device will not accept a shooting command before this time interval expires. Although by power cycling the device could be forced to shoot immediately, without waiting for the inter-shot interval time expiration. This will probably destroy the device. THEREFORE DO NOT BYPASS WAITING TIME!

# **12** FLUID

![](_page_13_Picture_6.jpeg)

The fluid solution is provided in non-pressurized cartridge making it easy to substitute. A self-aligning mechanism ensures that the cartridge is always fitted correctly. The contents of the cartridges are mechanically determined and may vary + or - 5%, and each cartridge contains enough fluid to allow for 2 full time shots (60 s) and at least one test shot (2 s). Fluid cartridges are disposable and CANNOT be recharged.

#### Technical data (Table E)

* The cubic meters of generated fog are based on the rules defined by the EN 50131-8: 2019 standard which prescribes a visibility of less than 1 meter. The cubic meters of generated fog mentioned in the table are based on the UR Fog standard which prescribes a visibility of 50 cm.

#### Insert or change the fluid cartridge

NOTE 1: The device will autonomously detect a low fluid condition and it will stop shooting. In this case no try to shoot again!

NOTE 2: Before removing the cabinet, check that the alarm control unit is in the "Service" condition, so as to be sure not to cause accidental shot.

NOTE 3: To insert or change the fluid cartridge is not necessary to turn off the fog generator.

WARNING!! All UR FOG fogging systems should only be used with UR FOG-branded fluids. It is strictly forbidden to use any fluid not previously authorized in writing by UR FOG srl.

There are 3 cartridge handling conditions:

- FIRST INSTALLATION
- CARTRIDGE REPLACEMENT IN FLUID ALARM CONDITION AND EMPTY CARTRIDGE (cartridge ended during shot, firing test with cartridge empty or without cartridge)
- CARTRIDGE REPLACEMENT WITHOUT FLUID ALARM CONDITION OR WITH ALARM CONDITION BUT CARTRIDGE NOT EMPTY

For each condition, follow the procedure below:

- 1. Unscrew the empty cartridge
- 2. Insert the new cartridge and screw it all the way in without overtightening
- 3. Press the FLUID button (S2) for 5 seconds (buzzer sounds) until pump activation is heard **
- 4. Perform a 2 seconds shooting test following the procedure below:
	- take note of the switch S1 position (shooting time)
		- program the 2 seconds shooting test (S1: 1 low-2 low)
		- make the 2 seconds shooting test **
		- reprogram the original shooting time

The procedure can be defined as completed only in the absence of errors at the end of shooting (red led off). Otherwise (red led on) repeat the procedure from point 3

![](_page_14_Picture_14.jpeg)

** A few drops of fluid may come out of the nozzle. During these phases, do not position yourself in front of the nozzle and direct the shoot towards an area that cannot be damaged by any residual fog fluid.

NOTE 4: At each cartridge change, check that the silicone nozzle protection is integral with the nozzle itself and does not come off easily. In this second case, replace the protection with a new on one.

# **13** BATTERIES

![](_page_14_Picture_19.jpeg)

#### Insert or change the batteries

To insert and replace the batteries, follow the rules as below:

- Open the compartment cover
- Disconnecting and removing the old batteries (if present)
- Insert the new batteries into the compartment
- Close the compartment cover ensuring that the battery supply cables are out and accessible
- Connect the batteries connectors firmly AS FAR AS THEY WILL GO
- The buzzer plays three notes and the three LEDs blink for 5 seconds (Low power mode) or steady on (Always on mode)

BAT 300 Tempest Technology is powered by two, bespoke, lead acid VRLA 12 V - 9 Ah batteries. With healthy and fully charged batteries it can remain operational without recharging for more than 6 months. At 6 months it is still able to perform a full shot of 60 seconds.

#### For use in the absence of power supply (stand alone mode) it is necessary to fully charge the batteries before the first activation.

NOTE 1: The use of standard batteries available on the market doesn't guarantee the performances declared in this manual

![](_page_15_Picture_0.jpeg)

NOTE 2: after 2 minutes from the connection the electronic board test the batteries powering the heating system. At this time a small puff of fog might come out from the nozzle. Don't stand in front of the nozzle in this period.

NOTE 3: in any case, don't position yourself below one meter away from the nozzle when the device is switched on.

# **14** EXTERNAL LEDs

![](_page_15_Picture_4.jpeg)

BAT 300 Tempest Technology provide three external LEDs. The LEDs will emit a short blink once per minute (Low-power mode) or are always active (Always on mode) as follows:

Red LED to indicate the empty fluid or a fault

Blue LED to indicate the arm status

Green LED to indicate the ready condition

See Chapter 18 about errors and their solutions.

# **15** FINAL TEST

At the end of each installation it is essential to test the entire safety system (alarm panel, fog generator, other devices). Here's a CHECKLIST example for finalizing the installation:

- Check all signals to and from the alarm system
- Check that the fog device is READY before carrying out the test (System READY = GREEN LED on)
- Make a FULL TEST SHOOTING at the installation site, to ensure that the dimensioning is OK
- After the test insert a new refill and RESET the fluid counter
- Register the device on the free ACTIVE CLOUD platform (if an ACTIVE CLOUD LAN WiFi card is present)
- Make sure to give a full INSTRUCTION to the end-user of this installation

# **16** APPLICATION OF THE WINDOW STICKER

![](_page_16_Picture_1.jpeg)

The window sticker provided with each UR Fog fog Generator is required to warn and deter intruders from committing theft in the protected facility. The signage must be displayed prominently on the building protected by the UR Fog fog generator according to EN50131-8:2019. It is double-sided to allow visibility from the outside as well as from the inside.

# **17** PERIODIC CHECKS

UR Fog security fog systems do not require special controls. The system monitors its functions 24 hours a day, reporting any anomalies. It is therefore sufficient to manage the reports correctly.

It's however recommended to periodically check the entire safety system. Regarding the fog generator, here is an example of checklist:

- Make sure the batteries are not hot and / or swollen. In any case, always refer to chapter 13 Batteries
- Check that the closing screws and wall fixing screws are well tightened and if necessary tighten them fully
- Check that the nozzle is not deformed and that there are not foreign bodies inside it
- Check that the silicone nozzle protection is integral with the nozzle itself and does not come off easily. In this second case, replace the protection with a new on one
- Annually check the pneumatic seal of the circuit and the pump by firing fog. If you don't want to emit the set amount of fog, simply use the test shot function (2 seconds)
- Intervention report redaction and release of conformity declaration according to local rules
