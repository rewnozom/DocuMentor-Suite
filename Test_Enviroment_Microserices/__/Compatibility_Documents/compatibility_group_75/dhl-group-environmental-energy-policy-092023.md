![](_page_1_Picture_1.jpeg)

This Environmental and Energy Policy statement describes DHL Group's approach to environmental and energy management and applies to all global operations and business activities.

DHL Group is the world's leading mail and logistics group. In linking the world through the transport of goods and information, we facilitate economic growth and the creation of wealth. Leadership for us includes being a leader in terms of environmental protection - a key component of our business strategy which also focuses on achieving net zero logistics-related emissions by 2050.

We conduct our business in accordance with applicable laws and high ethical, social and environmental standards. These are fully anchored for the entire Group in our **@** Code of Conduct for employees, and in the **@** Supplier Code of Conduct for our suppliers and subcontractors.

Due to the nature of our core businesses, the primary focus of our efforts is on our greenhouse gas emissions and climate protection. However, our sustainability roadmap and Clean Operations program also covers a broad range of aspects such as energy, waste and local pollution.

We are committed to minimizing our impact on the environment and preventing pollution in all our activities by implementing an effective environmental and energy management system (according to ISO 14001 / ISO 50001) to continually improve our environmental and energy performance and to comply with applicable legal and other requirements.

Our goal is to offer sustainable solutions to our customers, and to operate an environmentally sustainable and energy efficient network through consideration of performance improvements in design and modification of facilities and transport infrastructure, and processes. We will achieve this goal by ensuring the availability of information and deploying necessary resources and connecting with our employees, customers, and other key stakeholders.

This Environmental and Energy Policy is binding for all operations, business activities and companies within DHL Group. It will help us to embed environmental and energy management topics into our business, thus helping us realize our stakeholders' expectations when it comes to sustainability performance and the decarbonization of our operations.

As an organization headquartered in the European Union, DHL Group is in scope of the European Union's Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD). Therefore, this

# <span id="page-3-0"></span>2 GROUP ENVIRONMENTAL TARGETS

By transforming our business towards Clean Operations, we strive to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. We have set new, ambitious targets to be achieved by 2030. These targets cover our own emissions (Scope 1 & 2) as well as emissions from transport services provided by our subcontractors (Scope 3).

Particularly important for achieving these goals by 2030 are planned decarbonization measures, for which we plan additional expenditures of up to €7 billion. These cover the increasing use of sustainable technologies and fuels in our fleets and buildings. Our efforts reflect in a range of environmentally friendly products that allow our customers to actively participate in our decarbonization journey.

# 2.1 SCIENCE-BASED TARGET FOR GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION REDUCTION BY 2030

Our 2030 target is to reduce the Group's overall Scope 1, 2 and transport-related Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions to below 29 million tonnes CO2e. This target has been developed based on the requirements of the Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi) and supports global efforts to limit global warming in line with the United Nations' Paris Agreement. The following sub-targets have been validated by SBTi in October 2022:

#### Target for Scopes 1 & 2:

DHL Group commits to reduce absolute Scopes 1 & 2 GHG emissions 42 % by 2030 from a 2021 base year. This sub-target is in line with requirements to limit global warming to below 1.5 degrees Celsius.

### Target for Scope 3:

DHL Group commits to reduce absolute Scope 3 GHG emissions from fuel- and energyrelated activities, upstream transportation and distribution and business travel 25 % by 2030 from a 2021 base year. This sub-target is in line with requirements to limit global warming to well-below two degrees Celsius.

Both sub-targets have been developed under consideration of a business-as-usual growth scenario for our operations until 2030.

### 2.2 NET-ZERO TARGET "MISSION 2050"

Our long-term objective is to reduce our GHG emissions to net zero by 2050. That means we will implement active decarbonization measures to reduce our GHG emissions (Scopes 1, 2 and 3) down to an unavoidable minimum, which is to be fully compensated for with countermeasures recognized by external standards (excluding offsetting).

# <span id="page-4-0"></span>3 CLEAN OPERATIONS ROADMAP AND MEASURES

Our environmental targets can only be achieved if we implement, steer and monitor a clear roadmap of decarbonization measures. Therefore, we have defined a transition plan with key performance indicators (KPIs) for all our business activities that we strive to achieve by 2030. In addition to these KPIs, we have identified a number of efficiency measures that will help us to reduce energy consumption across the Group.

# 3.1 SUSTAINABLE AVIATION

Aviation is the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in our business and therefore the area where we must invest time and resources to improving the most. Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) offer a viable alternative to fossil fuels for powering commercial aircraft with significant potential to reduce aviation's greenhouse gas emissions. To achieve this reduction, we focus on the following measures:

- **Main Focus – Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) blending:** > 30 % SAF blending for air transport by 2030 on Group average, and strategic partnerships with producers and carriers to secure sufficient and cost-effective SAF supply; the details of our approach to purchasing sustainable fuels are outlined in DPDHL's **@** Sustainable Fuel Policy.
- **Re-fleeting:** Continue to invest in the latest technology of most fuel-efficient, SAF capable, and alternative power solution assets available in the industry
- **Fuel optimization:** Improve flight operations efficiency by utilizing technology, ideal weight balance, and optimized network design and choosing efficient carriers
- **Drive innovation:** Support innovative technologies like the development of electric aircraft and ready to scale Power-to-Liquid SAF plants
- **Decarbonize our ground handling:** Use electrification and hydrogen technology to drive down emissions of ground operations at our major hubs

# 3.2 SUSTAINABLE OCEAN FREIGHT

In ocean freight, we exclusively act as a freight forwarder and do not operate any own vessels. Therefore, all GHG emissions from ocean freight are part of our Scope 3 footprint. In order to decarbonize, close collaboration with our carriers is required. To achieve this, we focus on the following measures:

- **Main Focus – Sustainable Marine Fuel (SMF) blending:** > 30 % SMF blending for ocean freight transport by 2030, strategic partnerships with producers and carriers to secure sufficient and cost-effective SMF supply; the details of our approach to purchasing sustainable fuels are outlined in DPDHL's **@** Sustainable Fuel Policy.

- **Network optimization:** Reduce greenhouse gas emissions through permanent network improvements
- **Strategic industry partnerships:** Foster technological and process developments for promising future technologies like Ammonia and Methanol within the industry through strategic partnerships throughout the whole value chain

### 3.3 SUSTAINABLE LINEHAUL ROAD FREIGHT AND LAST-MILE DELIVERY

To ensure excellence in our deliveries to our customers, we have initiated steps to make our last-mile delivery and line-hauls green, in close collaboration with our subcontractors in this area. To achieve decarbonization, we focus on the following measures:

- **Main Focus – Electrification of pick-up and delivery fleet:** Electrify 60 % of our lastmile delivery vehicles by 2030.
- **Main Focus – Sustainable Road Fuels & Technologies:** Grow sustainable fuel share to > 30 % by 2030 on Group average; the details of our approach to purchasing sustainable fuels are outlined in DPDHL's **@** Sustainable Fuel Policy
- **Fuel Optimization:** Reduce fuel use through permanent network improvements
- **Innovation:** Promote development and availability of hydrogen and electric trucks
- **Behavior change:** Enable employee contribution through ecofriendly driving training

### 3.4 CARBON NEUTRAL BUILDINGS

Being the most international company in the world with operations in over 220 countries and territories, we use a considerable network of physical assets including warehouses, sorting centers, hubs, terminals and office buildings. We aim to leverage the latest green technologies to have carbon neutral buildings across our businesses worldwide. To achieve this, we focus on the following measures:

- **Main Focus – Carbon neutral design:** Since 2021, we apply a carbon neutral design to all new buildings, as well as to strategic existing buildings; to the remainder of our portfolio we will apply low carbon levers as feasible.
- **Green electricity:** Keep high share of green electricity at above 90 % until 2030 and focus on direct energy generation or procurement from sustainable sources; the details of our approach to purchasing green electricity are outlined in DPDHL's **@** Green Electricity Guidance.

![](_page_5_Picture_13.jpeg)

- **Sustainable heating:** Foster roll-out of sustainable heating of our buildings through heat pumps and sustainable fuels; the details of our approach to purchasing sustainable fuels are outlined in DPDHL's **@** Sustainable Fuel Policy
- **Sector coupling:** Convert locally produced renewable electricity (e.g. solar power) into fuels for our fleet, using either electricity directly or e-fuels
- **Digitalization:** Use intelligent, digital building management systems to further reduce energy consumption
- **Sustainable construction:** Fostering the use of alternative construction materials, to reduce embedded carbon

# 3.5 GREEN PACKAGING

Packaging is an essential part of our commercial offer as it helps to protect the goods we transport across our logistics and supply chain operations. Although there are many good reasons for the use of packaging in the logistics industry, we are conscious of the potential harm these products can have on the planet.

For the packaging categories that are mostly used in our operations (void fill, shipping labels, tape, mailing bags, pallet wrap, cardboard boxes), our **@** Green Packaging Standards set out the following aspirations:

- **Paper Packaging:** Use paper that is recycled, mixed or from sustainable forestry in accordance with **@** DPDHL Paper Policy
- **Plastic packaging:** Use a minimum of 30 % certified renewable material (recycled and/or bio-based) for shipping labels, tape and pallet wrap, and a minimum of 50 % of such certified material for void fill material and mailing bags

In addition, the **@** Green Packaging Principles provide overall guidance. By minimizing the material consumption in general, optimizing the use of single-use packaging and replacing it by reusable solutions where beneficial, we want to enable the lowest environmental packaging footprint possible and avoid waste across the Group.

# <span id="page-9-0"></span>5 ESG REPORTING AND CONTROLLING

#### ESRS GOV 1

We calculate our greenhouse gas emissions according to the internationally recognized Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate Standard and in accordance with the requirements of the European Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), the ISO 14083 and the ISO 14064 standards. We also follow the accounting methodology of the Global Logistics Emission Council (GLEC).

Our greenhouse gas emissions reflect the full lifecycle of the fuels and energy used; they are reported as well-to-wheel emissions.

The reporting of emissions from our own sources (Scope 1) and from energy supply (Scope 2) is linked to our financial accounting and reporting system. In this way, we can capture CO2-relevant consumption data (fuel, kerosene and energy consumption of our own fleet and buildings) via our financial systems and directly link it to our expense data for validation purposes.

For Scope 3 emissions, we have developed a staged method framework, which uses primary data where available from our large cooperation partners, and model based calculations based on operational data, such as shipments' weights, distances and types of vehicles and fuels; for residual categories models based on economic parameters can be applied.

The Corporate ESG Reporting and Controlling department is responsible for the measurement and reporting of DPDHL Group's greenhouse gas emissions, the progress toward the group's ESG ambitions and regulatory requirements. This includes the measurement of environmental, social and governance related data as well as the reporting of the same to internal and external stakeholders. Detailed descriptions of key performance indicators and reporting approaches are outlined in the **@** ESG Reporting Guideline and **@** Carbon Accounting Reporting Instructions documents.
