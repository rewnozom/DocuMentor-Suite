INSTALLATION AND USER GUIDE

### Device description an operation

The GSM device is an analog telephone line simulator, which can be used as an accessory to an alarm center to replace an already existing telephone line of poor quality or in a location that is otherwise difficult to install. The advantage of the module is the so-called Plug&Play design, thanks to which only an active SIM card is required to use the line simulator function.

A full PSTN line simulation can be achieved by generating line and ringing voltages and transmitting DTMF tones. This standard telephone line guarantees that you can connect the module to the existing system without any particular transition difficulties.

The GSM module is capable of two-way communication. In case of an incoming call, the device connected to the TIP/RING points can be remotely accessed and programmed (if the device is suitable for this and the available network conditions allow this).

Using the module SMS command, knowing the security code, the module settings can be modified at any time without having to establish physical access.

The module has 1 SMS input. This input can be closed to the GND point in the Normal position, i.e. Normal Close (NC). An SMS notification can be triggered by interrupting the closed loop formed between the input and the GND point. You can change the text of this SMS and the phone number to be notified at any time using 1 SMS.

The module has 1 open collector output, which is connected to GND when activated. If a relay is connected to it, one half of the relay must be connected to +12V and the other half to the Open collector for proper operation. For inductive loads (e.g. when using the aforementioned relay), the use of a protective diode is mandatory!

 The output can be controlled with a free call from an unlimited number. When controlling by calling number identification, the numbers are stored in the internal memory of the module (in this case, 1000 numbers can be entered). Call number identification prevents unauthorized control of the device connected to the output. The output can be loaded with 300mA and a maximum voltage of 30V can be connected to it.

In addition to continuously monitoring the power supply, the module also checks the status of the GSM field strength. It can be read on a graph that can be displayed with a resolution of up to 1 hour using the programming software.

The module can be programmed using an SMS command or programming software on a PC.

In a later development, with a simple FW update, it will be possible to convert Contact ID codes from the alarm center into text and send SMS to 8 specified phone numbers in addition to the line simulator functions.

### Installation steps

- 1. Carry out a signal strength check with your mobile phone. Sometimes occurs there is no sufficient signal strength at the commissioning site. In this case it is recommended to change module position prior to installation.
Do not install the device to places where strong electromagnetic waves might occur, ex. next to electric motors or alarm transformers!

- Do not install in watery places or in places with great humidity!
- 2. Connecting the antenna: antenna can be secured with an SMA connector. If you are reading low signal strength use antenna with higher gain. Signal strength grow can also be achieved by repositioning the antenna.
- Do not position the antenna under various metal covers as those might significantly ruin the signal strength!
- 3. You should opt out the SIM card PIN number request, voicemail and call notification!
- Sometimes new SIM cards must be activated (usually an outgoing call has to be made). Check the validity of the card. If you have a prepaid card check its balance and its usage possibilities (ex. calls only)
- 4. It is practical to check the satisfying operation of a SIM card in a cell phone prior of insertion into a module. At this step it is practical to also save controlling telephone numbers on the SIM card. Number identifying at the caller and the called has to be checked. At certain service providers this function must be enabled formerly.
- 5. Insert the SIM card in the SIM card slot of the module.
- 6. Connectors have to be connected according to the wiring diagram. If you are dealing with OC output mind the correct wiring of the relay protecting diode.
- 7. If you are working with OC relay be cautious especially in avoiding electric shocking. A proper contact protection must be established. If you are not qualified ask for professional help.
- 8. Check if the power supply performance will be sufficient for the module. Mind the polarity.

If wiring is reversed the module will not operate or might get damaged.

- 9. Now the device can be powered.
- 10. After connecting the voltage supply the red LED is lighted indicating the device establishing connection with the GSM system (this can be 1 minute utmost).
- 11. If red LED goes off and green LED is blinking module is online and connected to network. The blinking number(s) indicates GSM signal strength.

### The power supply must be connected for programming!

### LED signals

Signals give essential information of the module, of GSM signal strength and of possible errors. By blinking we mean flash numbers between two longer pauses.

- A Phone LED (red) lit indicates the device connected to the module ''picked up the phone''. Blinking of the LED indicates DTMF sound reception and dialing process.
- A STATUS LED (green) gives feedback of signal strength based on the chart below:

| Flashes     | Signal quality          |
|-------------|-------------------------|
| 1           | Bad                     |
| 2           |                         |
| 3           | Decent                  |
| 4           | Good                    |
| 5           | Excellent               |
| LED lighted | GSM connection rejected |

- An ACT LED (red) lit means the initiation process at startup. At this phase module performs the initial checkings.
In any other case an event sending is proceeded (SMS or voice call).

- A STATUS LED (green) gives feedback of signal strength based on the chart below:

| Flashes | Error code                    |
|---------|-------------------------------|
| 1       | Initializing                  |
| 2       | Bad GSM module                |
| 3       | SIM card not inserted         |
| 4       | SIM card locked with PIN code |

You can open the event log with the Maintenance → Read log button:

- The GSM module can store the last 16,000 events in FILO (First in last out) mode
- You will receive brief information about the event in the Signal column.
- In the Date column, you can see the time of the event (year, month, day, hour, minute, second resolution). IMPORTANT! The date will be accurate if the module's internal clock is synchronized with a computer clock or the GSM network. The latter is done automatically by the module as soon as it is connected to the provider's network.
- GSM 0-31 shows the value of the field strength when registering the signal. 31 is the highest value and 0 indicates no connection.
- Other extra information about the signal is entered in the comment/parameter column.
- When opened, the table is empty, to start reading, click the Read Event Log button.
- In terms of order, the most recent data will appear at the top of the list and the older entries will appear downwards.
- If it is not necessary to read the entire list, you can stop the reading by clicking the Stop Reading button.
- The read list can be exported from the software as a "csv" table (e.g. Excel), so it can be easily sent and stored for later analysis.

### GSM signal reading

You can display the graph shown in the picture about the state of the GSM signal strength.

- You can display the GSM field strength with the button Maintenance → Display GSM signal.
- You can read the values by pressing the read button.
- The change in field strength is displayed in hourly resolution. The elapsed time must be read backwards accordingly
- The diagram is divided from 0 to 31 on the vertical scale, the value 31 means the best field strength.
- The figure can be enlarged as desired with the left mouse button.

# Basic datas

You can enter more important information about the installed GSM module. In addition to the customer's name and installation address, you can also specify the phone number of the SIM card inserted in the module and the type of the connected alarm center.

- The entered data is stored on the module
- Completing it can be useful in case of maintenance performed later.

# Add phone numbers for notification

In the phone numbers menu, you can enter the numbers to which you want to send SMS and/or voice messages. The numbers entered here must be in international format for reliable operation. (Pl.:+36301234567 vagy 0036301234567)

- You can enter a maximum of 8 phone numbers to be notified.
- You can select these numbers in other parts of the program.
- You can also edit the list here via SMS with the command "TELx=Telephone number", where "x" denotes the serial number of the phone number you want to edit.
- (Example: 1234TEL1=+36301234567, 1234TEL2=+36304564323)
- More under SMS commands

# Add control phone numbers

- In the Control phone numbers window, you can specify which numbers can control your outputs.
- Phone numbers can be stored in the module's internal memory (up to 1000), and you can save additional numbers on the SIM card inserted in the module. Phone numbers on the SIM card can only be read with ProRead.
- If internal memory is used, the module will be independent of the memory content of the inserted SIM card.
- Before editing the list, always read the contents of the memory using the Read numbers from memory button. To save, use the Write numbers to memory button and then the send button.
- Entered phone numbers must be in international format. Here, due to the length of the number, +36 is recommended (e.g.: +36301234567).
- It is also possible to save, edit and open stored numbers (from a .csv file).
- You can also assign phone numbers to specific outputs.
- You can also modify the list using an SMS command using the commands ADD=Phone number (add) and DEL=Phone number (delete). (Példa: 1234ADD=+36301234567, 1234DEL=+36301234567)

# INPUT settings

The module has 1 SMS input. The type of input can be changed. It can connect to the GND point in a normal closed position, i.e. Normal Close (NC) or in a normal position, i.e. Normal Open (NO). By changing the loop formed between the input and the GND point, an SMS notification or a phone call can be triggered to up to 8 phone numbers. You can change the text of the SMS and the phone number to be notified at any time using 1 SMS.

In the Input panel, you can choose how the input should work:

- At the input, you can specify whether it should be open (NO Normal Open) or closed (NC Normal Close) by default.
- We can also request an SMS notification of the status of the input. The reset SMS text can be entered on the other tab in the SMS text for input reset.
- In the case of signaling with a siren sound, the voice call message will be a 25-second siren sound, while if you also select the voice message, then only 5 seconds.
- It is possible to set the call not to be answered. In this case, the module will not initiate a call again in case of a successful call, regardless of whether the call was actually received or not.
- In the SMS text field, you can enter the content of the message, which can be a maximum of 32 characters long.

# After saving the input settings, restart the module for the settings to work correctly!

# Output settings

In the Output window, you can make settings related to the outputs. The type of output can be monostable,

i.e. single-state (it switches for a preset time, then returns to its original state), or bistable, i.e. two-state (it returns to its original state only in case of a new control).

In the case of monostable operation, the desired switching time can be specified in seconds or minutes. The maximum length of this can be 65,535 seconds.

# After saving the output settings, restart the module for the settings to work correctly!

Setting the output is possible by sending the following message:

1234OUT1= → Optional parameteres: ON, OFF, RUN or switching for a specified time ( specified in 5 characters) ex: 1234OUT1=00003 → Control of Output 1 for 3 seconds.

# Power monitor settings

The GSM device is capable of monitoring its own power supply and sending notifications in the event of a problem.

- On the Power Monitor tab, you can set the voltage value below which the module sends an alarm.
- The additional settings of the function are the same as the settings of the inputs.

You can change the sending of the vital sign message with the SMS command below:

# 1234LIFETEST=cccsstttttttt

ccc → sending cycle specified in days (e.g.: 007 days)

ss → what time to send the messages on a given day

tttttttt → Whicj one phone number to send the messages to (ex.: 00100000 → sends the messages to 3 rd phone number)

#### Input other settings

Other module-related input settings are available here.

- Daily SMS limit: You can define how many SMSes the module can send in a day. This function can be turned off by setting the value to 255. If you set this limit to 0, the module will not send SMS!
- The maximum number of attempts in the event of an SMS sending error can also be set.
- Redirection of SMS received on the module to a given number to be notified. (SMS command: 1234REDIR=1...8)
- SMS header, the text of which will appear before the text of every SMS.

### Programming with SMS command

You can program the device by sending even 1 SMS. The text of the SMS must always start with the security code. Commands can be concatenated separated by commas, so you can change several parameters at once. The length of the SMS command cannot exceed 160 characters.

The list of commands is as follows:

Example of programming with the SMS command:

### 1234SMSTEL=06301111111,TELBE=06302222222, OUT=003, SMSPIN=1234, 1234ADD=+36301234567*

The EasyLine 4G module has an internal memory, so there is no need to save the phone number on the SIM card. Save our control phone numbers in the internal memory.

After successful programming, the module sends back an SMS with the following text:

### "Stored:1 Error:0 V4.7"

If there was an error in the programming SMS, the device will return the following text:

# "Stored:0 Error:1 V4.7"

If you do not want to receive this message, use the NOSMS command or the RECALL command, after which the module will call to indicate successful programming.

# Criteria for commands:

- cannot contain accented characters
- all characters of the command are uppercase
- commands must be separated by a space
- you can also use # instead of the equals sign.
- messages must always start with the security code, after which the first command comes immediately without a space (the second command must be preceded by a space).
- the SMS text command must always be closed with a * character
