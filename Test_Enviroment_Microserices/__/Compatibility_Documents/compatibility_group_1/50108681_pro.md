# CU50ENSVN Control Unit On-line SVN

![](_page_0_Picture_2.jpeg)

The SALTO CU50ENSVN is an On-Line Control Unit that can have 1 or 2 wall readers connected, has 2 control relay outputs and has SALTO Virtual Net (SVN) capabilities. It allowes cards to be automatically updated with the latest changes in the access plan, it records the user audit into the PC, provides advanced information on battery status and continually updates the cancelled ID carrier black list.

Access control changes can be carried out on the SALTO software and are then actioned at these control units in real time. It provides full On-Line features via networked Ethernet / Wifi link such as door monitoring status, remote door release and Roll-Call.

The control unit switches two relay outputs in order to manage and control locking devices as electric strikes, mag-locks, barriers, door closer, interlock, lifts and elevators, automatic doors, etc, with the control of an On-Line system and the security of the SALTO Virtual Network.

### Access control features
