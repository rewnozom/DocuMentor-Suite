"Clock" (pixel frequency) can control the pixels scanned by a single horizontal scanner. In the case of frequency error, vertical strips appear on the display, and an abnormal image ratio will be caused.

"Phase" can be used to adjust the phase of the pixel frequency signal. In the case of correcting the wrong phase, horizontal interference will appear in the brighter image.

## **4.1 Error information and feasible solution**

No signal

- 1. Please check if the signal wire is well connected. If the connector is loose, please fasten the screw on the joint.
- 2. Please check whether the connecting pin of the signal wire is damaged.

Does not support input signal

Incorrect display mode setup of the computer. Please refer to the display modes in the specification table to perform setting.
