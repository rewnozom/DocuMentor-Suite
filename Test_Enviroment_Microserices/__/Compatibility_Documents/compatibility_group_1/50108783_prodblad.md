Smart, secure and innovative, XS4 electronic handle sets for Scandinavian locks have been specially designed to operate on existing Scandinavian modular locks and cylinders. those versions need no hard wiring and provide a totally wire free networked electronic locking solution with a great range of features.

Furthermore, the Mifare RFID contact less ID technology read & write information on contact less smart cards (RFID) compatible with ISO 14.443A, ISO 14.443B and ISO 15.693 (VICINITY) standards, and as MIFARE, DESfire or VICINITY technologies. They also allow for updating of the SALTO Virtual Net (SVN) technology.

These SALTO electronic locks are compatible with NFC (Near Field Communication) technology which allows NFC enabled cell phones to act as contactless data carriers to open and control SALTO access controlled doors.

It offers no end of interesting possibilities in multiplication with other systems using the same card. With simple and intuitive use and the possibilities that the ID Carrier is available in many shapes make this system ideal for special needs applications.
