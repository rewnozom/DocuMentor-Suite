### Vivid night vision.

*Data comes from strict tests in the EZVIZ lab, under standard conditions.

Integrating a PIR sensor and the person-shape detection algorithm, the BC1 camera is intelligent enough to distinguish persons from other moving objects, keeping you safe while also reducing unwanted notifications.

### Motion alerts are more accurate than ever.

Users can set specific time frames for detection. Once the camera detects a person-shape, the BC1 will automatically set off a siren and flash two spotlights* to let them know they have been detected.

#### A vigilant guard over your property.

*The spotlights will not flash when color night vision mode is enabled.

A thoughtful product by design, the BC1 allows you to create unique voice messages* for greeting or deterrence.

### Customizable voice messages.
