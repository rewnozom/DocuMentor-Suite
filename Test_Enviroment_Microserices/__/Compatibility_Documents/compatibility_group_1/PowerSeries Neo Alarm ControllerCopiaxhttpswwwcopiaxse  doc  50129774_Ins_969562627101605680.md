*These units draw current from the Corbus to power devices external to the module. This current must be added to the total Corbus current. See manufacturer's specifications for the current draw of each device.

** For HSM2955 current draw refer to HSM2955 installation manual.

## **Line Loss**

Voltage loss through wire resistance must be considered for all installations. To ensure proper operation, at least 12.5VDC must be applied to all modules on the system (when AC is connected and the battery is fully charged). If less than 12.5VDC is applied, system operation is adversely affected.

To correct the problem, try any or all of the following:

1. Connect a HSM2300/2204 power supply between the alarm controller and the module to provide additional power to the Corbus.

2. Reduce the length of the Corbus run to the module.

3. Increase the gauge of wire.

## **Capacitance Limits**

An increase in capacitance on the Corbus affects data transmission and causes the system to slow down. Capacitance increases for every foot of wire added to the Corbus. The capacitance rating of the wire used will determine the maximum length of the Corbus.

For example, 22-gauge, non-shielded, 4-conductor wire has a typical capacitance rating of 20 picofarads per foot (which is 20nF/1000'). For every 1000' of wire added – regardless of where it is run – the capacitance of the Corbus increases by 20nF.

The following table indicates the total wire distance allowed for the capacitance rating of the wire used:

## **Table 2-3 Wire Capacitance**

| Wire Capacitance per 1000' (300m) | Total Corbus Wire Length |  |
|-----------------------------------|--------------------------|--|
| 15nF                              | 5300'/1616m              |  |
| 20nF                              | 4000'/1220m              |  |
| 25nF                              | 3200'/976m               |  |
| 30nF                              | 2666'/810m               |  |
| 35nF                              | 2280'/693m               |  |
| 40nF                              | 2000'/608m               |  |

# **2.4 Installing Modules**

Remove all power from the system while connecting modules to the alarm controller.

# **2.4.1 Zone Expander**

The main alarm controller has connection terminals for zones 1 to 8. Additional HSM2108 zone expanders may be added to increase the number of zones on the system. Each zone expander consists of one group of 8 zones. At enrollment, the zone expander is automatically assigned to the next available zone slot. Connect the RED, BLK, YEL and GRN terminals to the Corbus terminals on the alarm panel. Board current draw: 30mA.

![](_page_18_Figure_1.jpeg)

## **Figure 2-4 HSM2108 Zone Expander**

Refer to the HSM2108 installation sheet for more information.

# **2.4.2 Output Expander**

The HSM2208 module is used to add up to 8 low-current programmable outputs to the alarm system.

The 4-wire Corbus connection is used by the panel to communicate with the module. Connect the RED, BLK, YEL and GRN terminals to the Corbus terminals on the alarm panel. Board current draw: 40mA.

![](_page_18_Figure_7.jpeg)

**Figure 2-5 HSM2208 Output Expander**

# **2.4.3 Wireless Transceiver Module**

The HSM2HOSTx 2-way wireless integration module provides communication between wireless devices and the alarm controller.

Connect the HSM2HOSTx to the 4-wire Corbus of the alarm controller according to the following diagram.

![](_page_18_Figure_12.jpeg)

## **Figure 2-6 HSM2HOSTx Wiring Diagram**

After you have completed the wiring, reconnect power to the security system. Board currant draw: 35mA

# **2.4.4 Power Supply Wiring**

The HSM2300/2204 power supply/high-current output module provides up to 1.0A of additional current and can be used to add up to four programmable outputs (HSM2204 only) to the alarm system.

The 4-wire Corbus connection provides communication between the module and alarm panel. Connect the RED, BLK, YEL and GRN terminals to the Corbus terminals on the alarm controller. If O1 is not used, connect to Aux with a 1K resistor. Board current draw: 1.2A.

![](_page_19_Figure_4.jpeg)

## **Figure 2-7 Power Supply Wiring**

# **2.4.5 Keypad Wiring**

To wire a keypad to the alarm controller, remove the keypad backplate (refer to the keypad installation sheet) and connect the RED, BLK, YEL and GRN terminals to the corresponding terminals on the alarm controller.

## **Keypad Zone/PGM Wiring**

Hardwired devices can be connected to hardwired keypads with inputs (zone) or outputs (PGM). This saves from running wires back to the control panel for every device.

To connect a zone device to HS2LCD, HS2ICON, HS2LED and HS2TCHP keypads, run one wire to the P/Z terminal and the other to B. For powered devices, use red and black to supply power to the device. Run the red wire to the R (positive) terminal and the black wire to the B (negative) terminal.

Keypad zones support Normally Closed Loops, Single End of Line and Double End of Line.

To connect the PGM output, run one wire to the P/Z terminal and the other to R.

![](_page_20_Figure_1.jpeg)

## **Figure 2-8 Keypad P/Z Terminals**

**Note:** When using end of line supervision, connect the zone according to one of the configurations outlined in "Zone Wiring" on page 21. End of line resistors must be placed on the device end of the loop, not at the keypad.

## **Assigning Keypad Zones**

When using keypad zone inputs, each input used must be assigned a zone number in Installer Programming.

First, ensure that you have enrolled all installed keypads into the desired slots (See "[902] Add/Remove Modules" on page 117). Next, assign keypad zones by entering programming section [861]-[876], subsection 011 for keypads 1-16. Enter a 3 digit zone number for each of the keypad zones. This number must be programmed into the slot location that the keypad is assigned to.

**Note:** If a keypad zone input is assigned to zone number 1 to 8, the corresponding zone cannot be used on the main control panel.

Once the keypad zones are assigned, you must also program zone definitions and zone attributes. See "[001] Zone Types" on page 64 and See "Zone Setup" on page 64.

# **2.4.6 HSM2955 Wiring**

For wiring information refer to HSM2955 Installation manual #29008435xxx.

# **2.4.7 Alternate Communicator Wiring**

See Alternate Communicator installation manual.

# **2.4.8 Zone Wiring**

Power down the alarm controller and complete all zone wiring.

Zones can be wired to supervise normally open devices (e.g., smoke detectors) or normally closed devices (e.g., door contacts). The alarm panel can also be programmed for single end-of-line or double end-of-line resistors.

Zone programming is done using the following programming sections:

- l [001] selects zone definition
- l [013] Opt [1] for normally closed or EOL; Opt [2] for SEOL or DEOL
- l [201 208] partition assignment.

Observe the following guidelines when wiring zones:

- l For UL listed installations use SEOL or DEOL only
- l Minimum 22 AWG wire, maximum 18 AWG
- l Do not use shielded wire
- l Do not exceed 100Ω wire resistance. Refer to the following table:

## **Table 2-4 Burglary Zone Wiring Chart**

| Wire Gauge                                              | Maximum Length to EOL Resistor (ft/meters) |  |  |  |
|---------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|--|--|--|
| 22                                                      | 3000 / 914                                 |  |  |  |
| 20                                                      | 4900 / 1493                                |  |  |  |

| Figures are based on maximum wiring resistance of 100Ω. |                                            |  |  |  |

## **Normally Closed**

Connect hardwired devices to any Z terminal and any Com terminal. Wire normally closed devices in series.

**Note:** For UL Installations, do not use normally closed loops.

![](_page_21_Figure_6.jpeg)

## **Figure 2-9 Normally Closed**

The following table shows zone status under certain conditions for NC Loops:

## **Table 2-5 NC Loop Status**

| Loop Resistance                   | Loop Status |  |  |
|-----------------------------------|-------------|--|--|
| 0Ω (shorted wire, loop shorted)   | Secure      |  |  |
| Infinite (broken wire, loop open) | Violated    |  |  |

## **Single End-of-Line (SEOL) Resistor**

When SEOL resistors are installed at the end of a zone loop, the alarm panel detects if the circuit is secure, open, or shorted. The SEOL resistor must be installed at the end of the loop for proper supervision.

To enable SEOL supervision, program section [013], options [1] and [2] to OFF.

**Note:** This option should be selected if either normally closed or normally open detection devices or contacts are used.

![](_page_21_Figure_15.jpeg)

## **Figure 2-10 SEOL Wiring**

The following table shows zone status under certain conditions for SEOL:

## **Table 2-6 SEOL Loop Status**

| Loop Resistance                   | Loop Status |
|-----------------------------------|-------------|
| 0Ω (shorted wire, loop shorted)   | Violated    |
| 5600Ω (contact closed)            | Secure      |
| Infinite (broken wire, loop open) | Violated    |

## **Double End of Line (DEOL) Resistors**

When double end-of-line (DEOL) resistors are installed at the end of a zone loop, the second resistor enables the panel to determine if the zone is in open, closed, tampered or faulted.

**Note:** Any zone programmed for Fire or 24-hr Supervisory must be wired with a SEOL resistor regardless of the type of zone wiring supervision selected for the panel. If you change the zone supervision options from DEOL to SEOL or from NC to DEOL, power the system down completely, then power it back up for correct operation.

To enable DEOL supervision, program section [013], option [1] to OFF and option [2] to ON.

![](_page_22_Figure_5.jpeg)

## **Figure 2-11 DEOL Wiring**

**Note:** If the DEOL supervision option is enabled, all hardwired zones must be wired for DEOL resistors, except for Fire and 24 Hour Supervisory zones. Do not use DEOL resistors for Fire zones or 24 Hour Supervisory zones.

**Note:** Do not wire Fire zones to keypad zone terminals if the DEOL supervision option is selected.

**Note:** This option can only be selected if N/C detection devices or contacts are used. Only one N/C contact can be connected to each zone.

The following table shows zone status under certain conditions for DEOL:

## **Table 2-7 DEOL Loop Status**

| Loop Resistance                   | Loop Status |
|-----------------------------------|-------------|
| 0Ω (shorted wire, loop shorted)   | Fault       |
| 5600Ω (contact closed)            | Secure      |
| Infinite (broken wire, loop open) | Tamper      |
| 11200Ω (contact open)             | Violated    |

# **2.4.9 PGM Wiring**

Min/max operating voltages for devices, sensors and modules is 9.5VDC - 14VDC.

PGMs switch to ground when activated from the alarm controller. Connect the positive side of the device to the AUX+ terminal and the negative side to a PGM terminal.

PGM 1, 3, 4 supply up to 50mA; PGM 2 supplies up to 300mA.

A relay is required for current levels greater than 50mA or 300mA. PGM2 can also be used for 2-wire smoke detectors, 24-hr burglary input alarm.

**Note:** Use SEOL resistors on Fire zones only.

## **Figure 2-18 Ground Installation**

**Note:** Using an insulated green wire (minimum 22AWG), connect the EGND terminal on the Corbus and the grounding wire from the building electrical installation to any of the available holes on the back or side of the metal cabinet. See the diagram attached to the cabinet for suggested GND point location and hardware recommendations.

**Note:** Wire and installation hardware not included.

# **2.4.15 Connecting Power**

#### **Batteries**

Do not connect the battery until all other wiring is complete.

**Note:** A sealed, rechargeable, lead acid battery or gel type battery is required to meet UL requirements for power standby times.

Connect the RED battery lead to the positive battery terminal and the BLACK battery lead to the negative battery terminal.

The panel can be programmed to charge the battery at 400mA or 700mA. (See "[982] Battery Settings" on page 120).

**Note:** Refer to "Aux Loading and Battery Selection" on page 1.

## **Battery Selection Chart**

After calculating the battery capacity **(B)** for each specific installation use the following table to determine the battery required to support the main panel in standby mode for

- l 4 hours (UL commercial burglary/residential burglary),
- l 12 hours (EN50131),
- l 24 hours (UL/ULC residential fire, ULC commercial burglary, ULC commercial fire monitoring no bell load allowed; INCERT [Belgium]) or
- l 36 hours (NFA2P [France]).

The battery size is measured in amp hours (Ah). The current values in the table denote the maximum current draw permitted to achieve the desired standby time with the listed battery types.

| Battery Size                                                                       | Desired Standby Time |        |        |        |

## **Table 2-12 Standby Battery Guide**

* use 2 x 7Ah batteries connected in parallel, UL/ULC installations only

**Note:** Battery capacity deteriorates with age and the number of charge/discharge cycles. Replace every 3-5 years.

Refer to See "Regulatory Approvals" on page 208 for detailed Aux. loading and battery charging information.

## **Connecting AC Power**

The alarm controller requires a 16.5V, 40VA transformer. While unplugged, connect the transformer to the AC terminals on the controller. The alarm controller can be programmed to accept a power line frequency of either 50Hz AC or 60Hz AC. See programming section [024], option [1].

**Note:** For UL/ULC installations use only 60Hz.

**Note:** For ULC S559 applications, Standex transformer (Model FTC3716) shall be employed for direct-wiring.

# **3.2 Using the Keypad**

The PowerSeries Neo alarm panel is compatible with several different keypad types (see "Compatible Devices" on page 9); However, all keypads have certain basic functionality in common.

# **3.2.1 Special Keys**

Scroll symbols < > on keypads with LCD displays indicate that options can be viewed by pressing the scroll keys. These keys can also be used to position the cursor.

The [*] key is similar in function to the "Enter" key on a personal computer. It is generally used to accept the existing programming option. It is also the first key entry for [*] commands and can be used to enter the letters A-F when in Installer Programming mode.

The [#] key is similar in function to the "ESC" (escape) key on a personal computer. It is generally used to exit the current programming section or to return to the previous one.

# **3.2.2 LED Indicators**

Keypads have the following status lights that provide visual indication of basic system status:

**Ready:** Panel is ready to be armed.

**Armed:** Panel is armed.

**Trouble:** System trouble. Enter [*][2] to view troubles.

**AC Power**: ON=AC present. OFF=AC absent.

## **Panel Status LED Operation**

The red status LED, located on the alarm controller PCB, indicates the following:

- l Power up sequence flashes rapidly until the end of the power-up sequence.
- l Firmware indication flashes during the firmware upgrade process. If the firmware upgrade fails, the LED flashes rapidly.
- l Trouble indication Flashes when troubles are present. Troubles are indicated according to the following priority:

1 flash - no keypads enrolled

2 flashes - module supervision trouble

3 flashes - bus low voltage

- 4 flashes low battery trouble 5 flashes - AC trouble 6 flashes - AUX trouble
- 7 flashes bell trouble

8 flashes - TLM trouble

## **How to Enter Data**

#### **Conventions Used In This Manual**

Brackets [ ] indicate numbers or symbols that must be entered on the keypad.

e.g., [*][8][Installer Code][804] requires the following key entries:

#### [*][8][5555][804]

[*] initiates a special command.

[5555] is the default installer code. The default installer code should be changed during initial programming of the system.

[804] indicates the particular programming section being accessed.

## **Entering Letters Manually (System Labels)**

1. In Installer Programming, enter the section requiring text input.

2. Use the arrow keys [<][>] to move the cursor to a blank space or existing character.

3. Press the number key corresponding to the appropriate letter. Each number button accesses three letters and a number. The first press of the number key displays the first letter. The second press displays the second letter, etc.

# **3.3 Enrollment**

All optional modules and devices must be enrolled on the system. During enrollment, the electronic serial number (ESN) of each device is identified to the control panel and zones are assigned. A wireless transceiver HSM2HOST or an RF keypad must be enrolled first before wireless devices can be enrolled.

# **3.3.1 Enrolling Modules**

During automatic and manual enrollment, if an attempt is made to enroll more than the maximum number of modules, an error tone sounds and a message is displayed on LCD keypads.

## **Table 3-1 Module Capacity**

Modules can be enrolled automatically or manually using section [902] of Installer programming. For instructions on enrolling modules, see "Module Programming" on page 117.

To confirm that a module has been successfully enrolled, use Installer Programming section [903]. See "[903] Confirm Module" on page 118 for details.

## **Enrolling the First Keypad**

To enroll a hardwired keypad, connect the keypad to the alarm controller, power up the alarm panel then press any button on the keypad.

To enroll a wireless keypad, first connect the HSM2HOSTx wireless integration module to the alarm controller. Next, power up the alarm panel and a wireless keypad. Press any button on the keypad to enroll it on the HSM2HOSTx. The HSM2HOSTx is then enrolled on the alarm panel. To enroll other keypads, see "Module Programming" on page 117.

# **3.3.2 Module Supervision**

By default, all modules are supervised upon installation. Supervision is enabled at all times so that the panel can indicate a trouble if a module is removed from the system.

To check which modules are currently connected and supervised, see "[903] Confirm Module" on page 118.

If a module is connected but is not recognized by the system, it may be due to any of the following reasons:

- l the module is incorrectly wired to the alarm controller
- l the module has exceeded its maximum wire run length
- l the module does not have enough power
- l the module is not enrolled on the wireless receiver

## **Removing Modules**

Enrolled modules can be deleted from the system via programming section [902]. For instructions, see "[902] Add/Remove Modules" on page 117.

# **3.3.3 Enroll Wireless Devices**

Wireless devices are enrolled via the wireless transceiver module and Installer Programming section [804][000]. See "Compatible Devices" on page 9 for a list of supported wireless devices.

Wireless devices are enrolled using one of the following methods:

## **Auto Enrollment**

To enroll a wireless device using this method, press and hold the Enroll button on the device for 2-5 seconds until the LED lights then release the button. The alarm panel automatically recognizes the device and the keypad displays a confirmation message. The device ID and next available zone number are displayed. Press [*] to accept or scroll to another available zone number. Batteries must be installed in the wireless device in order to enroll.

Various zone features are programmable depending on the type of device. See "Zone Setup" on page 64 for details.

## **Pre-Enrollment**

Pre-enrollment is a two step process. The first step requires entering each device ID ([804][001]-[716]). Every wireless device has an ID printed on the sticker attached to the device. The format is XXX-YYYY where:

- l XXX identifies the type or model of the device
- l YYYY is a short encrypted ID used by the system to identify the specific device

Pre-enrollment can be done at a remote location and using DLS/SA. The second step is to press the enrollment button on the device, usually done on location. Installer Programming does not have to be entered at this step. Both steps must be performed in order to complete the enrollment.

# **3.4 Working with Partitions**

A partition is a limited area of the premises that operates independently from the other areas. Partitioning a system can be beneficial if the property has outbuildings that need to be secured independently of a main area or if the home has a separate apartment.

Each partition can have its own keypad or a keypad can have access to all partitions (only if all partitions belong to the same owner). User access to partitions is controlled via access codes. A master code can access the entire system and partitions, while a user code is limited to assigned partitions.

Setting up a partition requires configuration of the following:

- l create the partition
- l define bell/siren operation
- l assign keypads
- l assign zones
- l assign users

# **3.4.1 Setting Up a Partition**

Partitions are added or removed from the system by applying or removing a partition mask via Installer Programming section [200]. The number of available partitions depends on the alarm panel model. See "[200] Partition Mask" on page 98 for more information.

# **3.4.2 Bell/Siren Operation**

Each partition must have a siren. The system siren connected to the bell output of the alarm controller can be mounted in a central location within hearing range of all partitions. Each partition can also have wireless sirens activated only on the assigned partition. See "Wireless Programming" on page 116 for details.

## **Single Siren Output Operation**

With a siren shared across all partitions, control over activation/deactivation of the output depends on the partition that initiated the alarm sequence. Only the partition that originated the alarm can deactivate the bell output.

Global zones, such as smoke detectors shared by multiple partitions, can deactivate the siren on all partitions the zone is assigned to.

## **Multiple Siren Output Operation**

When multiple sirens are used in the installation, they can be programmed to sound alarm conditions for all partitions, or for individual partitions by using a partition enable mask.

If hardwired sirens are used, this is accomplished via bus power supplies with a supervised high-current output. The output is then programmed as a Fire and Burglary PGM output type.

**Note:** Only the first output of the HSM2204 output module has bell supervision. Some conditions, such as an installer system test, may override the partition assignment and cause all sirens to activate. User system tests only activate the sirens/outputs assigned to that partition.

# **3.5 Trouble Indicators**

Both audible and visual trouble indications are available on all partitions. For more information, see "[*][2] Trouble Display" on page 44.

Programming section [013] option 3 controls whether or not troubles are indicated when the alarm system is armed.

# **3.6 Keypad Partition Setup**

Keypads can be configured to control an individual partition or all partitions. In general, a partition keypad controls the partition it is assigned to. A Global keypad controls all partitions. Global keypads should be placed in common areas of the premises, such as points of entry or reception areas, where the ability to arm and disarm more than one partition at a time is required.

Partition keypads can also be temporarily loaned to other partitions.

To select a keypad operating mode:

1. Enter Installer Programming: [*][8][installer code].

- 2. Select [861]-[876] to program keypads 1-16.
	- l Press [000] for partition assignment.
	- l For Global operation, key in 00.
	- l To assign a keypad to a partition, key in 01-08 for partition 1-8.

3. Press the [#] and reapeat step 2 for next keypad. When finished programming all keypads, press the [#] key twice to exit programming.

Users are assigned partition access rights via the [*][5] menu.

# **3.6.1 Loaned Partition Setup**

To loan a keypad to another partition:

- 1. Press and hold [#]. The keypad switches to Global display.
- 2. Select a partition by pressing digits 1 to 8. The keypad is temporarily loaned to another partition.

If the keypad is inactive for more than 30 seconds, it reverts to its assigned partition.

# **3.6.2 Global Zones**

If a zone is added to more than one partition, it becomes a global zone. A global zone is only armed when all assigned partitions are armed and is disarmed when any assigned partition is disarmed.

Global zones behave as follows:

- l A global Stay/Away type zone is not activated until all partitions the zone is assigned to are armed in the Away mode. Interiors must be activated on all partitions for the global Stay/Away zone to be active.
- l A shared zone bypassed on one partition is bypassed on all partitions the zone is assigned to.
- l An entry delay started on a global zone sounds an entry delay on all keypads assigned to partitions the global zone is assigned to.
- l A global Delay type zone follows the longest programmed delay time of the partitions it is assigned to.

# **3.6.3 Fire and CO Zone Types**

Fire zones only place the partition they are assigned to into alarm. Other partitions retain their current state.

A fire **reset** only resets partitions they are assigned to.

One or more fire zones may be located on any partition.

On alarm, the fire auto-scroll display appears on all partition keypads and on all global keypads. Fire alarm silence and fire system reset may be done directly on any partition keypad. To silence a fire or CO alarm from a global keypad requires that the global keypad be loaned to one of the partitions the zone is assigned to.

# **3.6.4 Bell/PGM Support**

PGMs must be assigned to one or more partitions. See section [007] for partition assignment.

**Note:** Bell PGM type requires supervision and follows arming squawks by partition.

# **3.6.5 Communications**

Account codes are assigned to all system and partition events.

For SIA communications, a single account code (programmed in section [310][000]) is used for all events. The partition is identified via Nri1-8. System events use Nri0.

When using communication formats other than SIA, individual account codes can be programmed for each partition. See " [310] Account Codes" on page 106.

# **3.6.6 Assign Zones**

Partition zone assignments are completed using sections [201] - [208] for partitions 1 - 8. Subsections [001 - 016] are then used to enable or disable banks of 8 zones on the partition.

# **3.6.7 Assign Users**

Acess [*][5] using the master code, select the desired user code and enter digit 4 to modify the partitions that can accept the user code.

# **3.6.8 Factory Defaults**

Individual modules, as well as the alarm panel itself, can have their programming returned to factory default settings. Hardware is defaulted via the following Installer Programming sections:

- l [991] Default Keypads
	- l 000 Default all keypad programming
	- l 001-016 Default keypads 1-8
- l [993] Default alternate communicator
- l [996] Default wireless receiver
- l [998] Default HSM2955
- l [999] Default system

See "Defaults" on page 121 for more information.

## **Default All labels**

Use programming section [000][999]. The following labels are returned to factory default settings:

- l Zone Label
- l Partition Labels
- l Module Labels
- l Partition 1-8 Command Output 1 to 4 Labels
- l Schedule 1 to 4 Labels
- l Event Labels
- l User Labels

System and module programming is not affected.

## **Hardware Reset Main Control Panel**

Perform the following to restore the main control panel to default settings:

- 1. Power down the system.
- 2. Remove all wires between Zone 1 and PGM 1 on the alarm controller.
- 3. Connect a short between Zone 1 and PGM.
- 4. Power up the system (AC only) for 60 seconds.
- 5. Power down the system and remove the short.
- 6. Power up the system again. Factory defaults are restored.

Hardware default is logged to the event buffer.

**Note:** Hardware default is not available when installers lockout is enabled.

# **3.7 Alternate Communicator Setup**

The alternate communicator is an optional wireless or ethernet communications device that can be used as a backup to the PSTN connection or as a primary means of communication between the alarm panel and the central monitoring station. The alternate communicator communicates via 3G (HSPA) or Ethernet.

The following configuration steps are required to set up the alternate communicator:

- l Install the alternate communicator and wire it to the alarm panel (use PCLINK_2 header)
- l Enroll the alternate cellular communicator with Connect 24
- l Set the communication path: [300]
- l Enable the alternate communicator: [382] option 5
- l Enable event reporting: [307]/[308]
- l Program communication delay timer: [377]
- l Program DLS access: [401] option 07

Refer to the 3G2080(R)/ TL2803G(R)/ TL280(R) installation manual for details.

# **3.7.1 Real Time Clock**

This feature synchronizes the alarm panel time and date with that of the alternate communicator, provided real time clock support is available. Time and date are updated at 4:05 PM or when the system time is lost. This feature is enabled/disabled in Installer Programming section [024] option 5.

# **3.7.2 Communication Paths**

The path of communication between the alarm panel and the central station must be established through either the alarm panel's on-board Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) connection or through the alternate communicator (cellular or Ethernet) if equipped.

Paths to four receivers can be programmed in Installer Programming section [300] options 001 - 004.

For more information, see "[300] Panel/Receiver Communication Paths " on page 99.

# **3.7.3 Communications Options**

The following alarm panel options must be programmed when configuring the alternate communicator:

[300] option 02: communication path (see "[300] Panel/Receiver Communication Paths " on page 99)

[380] option 01: communications enabled/disabled (see "[380] Communicator Option 1" on page 109)

[382] option 05: enable communicator and all associated options: telephone number, reporting code and call direction (" [382] Communicator Option 3" on page 111)

[308][351]-[356] reporting codes (see "[351] Alternate Communicator 1")

[401] option 7: DLS access (see "[401] System Test Events")

# **3.7.4 Communication Attempt Limit**

If a telephone line monitoring (TLM) trouble is present, the number of PSTN dialing attempts is reduced from the programmed value to 0 attempts. See programming section [380] Communicator Option 1 for details.

# **3.7.5 Supervision Restore**

If the alarm system experiences a failure to communicate (FTC) with the central monitoring station, it automatically attempts to transmit the event when communications are restored.

# **3.7.6 Remote Firmware Upgrade**

Firmware upgrades can be automatically pushed to the alarm panel and modules from Connect 24 or DLS. A message is displayed on LCD keypads indicating a firmware upgrade is available. On all keypads, the blue proximity tag bar flashes one second on - one second off.

Users authorize the firmware upgrade through [*][6][Master Code][17].

During the update, a message indicating that a firmware upgrade is in progress is displayed on the LCD keypad. If the firmware update fails, an error message is displayed on LCD keypads.

Firmware updates are performed under the following conditions:

- l The system is not armed
- l No AC trouble is present
- l No low battery trouble is present
- l No FTC trouble is present
- l Every alarm in memory has been viewed
- l No events are being communicated
- l An alternate communicator is present

Remote firmware upgrade is possible for the following modules:

- l hardwired keypads, including HS2LCDRF
- l wireless transceivers
- l alternate communicators

**Note:** For UL listed installations, do not use remote programming unless an installer is on the premises.

# **3.8 Local Firmware Upgrade**

Alarm panel firmware can be upgraded locally via DLS. Firmware upgrade prevention rules are ignored when performing a local firmware upgrade.

**Note:** [382][5] must be enabled to perform a local firmware upgrade.

To perform a local firmware upgrade:

- 1. Remove the front cover of the alarm panel and plug the DLS header into the PCLink 2 connector on the alarm controller.
2. Open the Flash Utility within DLS, select the latest firmware file from the Web or browse to a saved flash file on your hard drive. Follow the steps as prompted by the Flash Utility application. A message is displayed when download is complete.

3. Once the firmware update is complete, the system powers up.

# **3.9 Testing the System**

## **Installer Walk Test**

Walk test enables the installer to test the operation of each detector by tripping zones, causing an actual alarm. Enter section [901] to initiate a walk test. When a zone is tripped, all system sirens emit a tone to indicate that the zone is working correctly. After 15 minutes without zone activity, the walk test terminates automatically. To manually exit walk test mode, enter [901] again.

# **3.9.1 Viewing the Event Buffer**

The event buffer contains logs of events that have occurred on the alarm system beginning with the most recent. The capacity of the event buffer is scalable and can hold 500/1000 events (depending on panel model) before rolling over. The buffer displays events according to their time stamp, beginning with the most recent. The event buffer can be uploaded using DLS. Each event displays the time and date, a description of the event, the zone label, access code number or any other pertinent information. To view the event buffer, press [*][6][Master Code][*].

# Section 4: System Operation

# **4.1 Arming and Disarming**

The following table describes the various arming and disarming methods available.

**Table 4-1 Arming/Disarming Methods**

| Method               | Description                                     |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Away Arm             | for 2 seconds + [Access Code*]                  |
| Stay Arm             | for 2 seconds + [Access Code*]                  |
| Night Arm            | when armed in stay mode [*][1] + [Access Code*] |

| Quick Arm/Quick Exit | [*][0]                                          |

* - requiring an access code can be programmed in Section [015]

For detailed arming/disarming instructions, see the PowerSeries Neo User Manual.

# **4.2 Partition vs. Global Keypad**

Keypads can be configured to control an individual partition or all partitions (see "Keypad Partition Setup " on page 33). Loaning a keypad to another partition does not require an access code; However, no function that requires an access code can be performed on that partition unless the user's code has sufficient permission.

# **4.2.1 Single Partition Operation**

Single partition keypads provide access to alarm functionality for an assigned partition.

Single partition keypads behave as follows:

- l Display the armed state of the partition
- l Display open zones, if the zone belongs to the partition the keypad is on
- l Display bypassed zones and allow zone bypassing or creating bypass groups of zones assigned to the keypad partition
- l Display system troubles (system low battery, system component faults/tampers)
- l Display alarms in memory that occurred on the partition
- l Allow the door chime to be enabled/disabled
- l Activate system test (sounds bells/PGMs assigned to the partition)
- l Allow label programming ( user labels for the partition)
- l Control command outputs (those assigned to the partition, or global outputs such as smoke detector reset)
- l Display temperature (not evaluated by UL)

# **4.2.2 Global/Multiple Partition Operation**

Global keypads display a list of all active partitions or assigned partitions along with their current state. The Global status screen displays the following:

12345678 (RA!N----)

- R = Ready
- A = Armed
- ! = Alarm
- N = Not Ready
- X = Exit Delay
- E = Entry Delay
- P = Pre-Alert
- = Partition not enabled

In the following example, partition 1 is armed, partition 2 is disarmed and ready, partition 3 is disarmed and not ready, partition 4 is in alarm, partition 5 is indicating exit delay, partition 6 is in entry delay, partition 7 is in auto-arm pre-alert and partition 8 is not enabled.

- **1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8**
**A R N ! X E P -**

Global keypads behave as follows:

- l Troubles are displayed and sounded on the global keypad. Troubles can be viewed from the global keypad display by pressing the right scroll key then (*). The Troubles menu is displayed. An access code may be required to enter the [*][2] menu depending on system programming.
- l Keypad function keys can be programmed for Global Stay Arm, Global Away Arm and Global Disarm.
- l Multiple partition arming may be done from a global keypad assigned to the same partitions as the user.

# **4.3 Labels**

Various custom labels can be created to make identification of the alarm system, partitions, zones and modules simpler. Labels are created by inputting text manually, by selecting words from the Word Library or by downloading/uploading using DLS. See "Adding Labels" on page 61

# **4.3.1 System Label**

- l power supply
- l 4 high-current output module
- l alternate communicator module
- l audio module
- l siren
- l repeater

The maximum label size is 14 ASCII characters.

See "[801] Keypad Labels" on page 63 for more details.

# **4.3.5 Event Labels**

Customizable labels can be created for the following events:

- l Fire alarm
- l Fail to arm
- l Alarm when armed
- l CO alarm

The maximum label size is 14 ASCII characters. See page 61 for more details.

# **4.3.6 Partition Command Output Labels**

This feature is used to program custom labels for command outputs. These labels are used with output activation events in the event buffer. The maximum label size is 14 x 2 ASCII characters. See "[201]-[208][001]-[004] Partition Command Output Labels" on page 63 for more details.

# **4.4 Annunciation**

# **4.4.1 Door Chime**

The keypad can be programmed to use one of four different door chime tones for each zone on the system. Chime is active only during the disarm state. Only one door chime option can be enabled for each zone.

- l Beeps
- l Bing-Bong
- l Ding-Dong
- l Alarm Tone
- l Zone Name Voice Annunciation (HS2LCDWF keypads only)

Chime is enabled/disabled on a partition using the [*][4] command.

# **4.4.2 Temperature Display**

Indoor and outdoor temperature can be displayed on system keypads if configured in keypad programming section [861]- [876]>[023] option 7, and sections [041]-[042]. Temperature is detected using wireless temperature sensors installed on the system. Refer to "Compatible Devices" on page 9.

Global keypads only display outdoor temperature.

# **4.4.3 Low Temperature Warning**

Keypads can be configured to detect low ambient temperature.

If the temperature at the keypad drops to 6° C ± 2° C (43° F ± 3°F), the keypad zone goes into alarm. When the temperature rises above 9° C ± 2° C (48° F ± 3° F), the keypad zone is restored.

When this option is enabled, the keypad's zone input functionality is disabled.

Refer to section [861]-[876]>[023] option 8 for more information.

**Note:** This feature has not been evaluated by UL/ULC.

If no Stay/Away zone types are programmed, the alarm system arms in Away mode.

**Note:** Do not use this function with CP-01 installations.

#### **[03] Stay Arm**

Only perimeter zones are armed. Interior zones are bypassed regardless of whether or not delay zones are tripped during the exit delay.

#### **[04] Away Arm**

All interior and perimeter zones are armed. CP-01 panels require an exit through a delay zone during the exit delay or the system will arm the perimeter zones only.

#### **[05] No-Entry Arm [*][9]**

All Delay 1 and Delay 2 zones become instant zones. If a door or window is opened the system goes immediately into alarm. This function is typically used when no occupants are expected to return to the site during the armed period. Activation of this function key requires an access code. This function only works while the system is disarmed.

See "[*][9] No-Entry Arming" on page 55 for more information.

#### **[06] Chime On/Off**

This function turns the door chime on or off and is the equivalent of pressing [*][4]. The alarm system must be disarmed to use this function. If option 7 in section [023] is enabled, this function key requires an access code.

# **4.7.1 [*][1] Bypass or Stay/Away/Night Zones**

The [*][1] command functions differently depending on whether the system is armed or disarmed.

**Note:** For UL/ULC listed installations, group bypass is not allowed.

## **When The Alarm System is Disarmed**

Users can bypass individual zones or a programmed group of zones using the [*][1] keypad command. Zones are commonly bypassed if users want to have access to an area while the partition is armed, or to bypass a defective zone (bad contact, damaged wiring) until service can be provided. A bypassed zone does not cause an alarm.

When the partition is disarmed, all zones that were bypassed using [*][1] are no longer bypassed, except for 24-hr zones.

If the Code Required for Bypass option is enabled, an access code is required to enter bypass mode. Only access codes with the Bypass attribute enabled can bypass zones (see "Access Code Attributes" on page 49).

## **Bypassing zones with an LCD keypad:**

1. Ensure the system is disarmed.

- 2. Press [*] to enter the function menu. The keypad displays "Press [*] for < > Zone Bypass."
- 3. Press [1] or [*], then key in your access code (if required).

4. Scroll to a zone or key in the three-digit zone number. Only zones enabled for zone bypassing are displayed. Enter the 3 digit zone number or scroll to the desired zone and press [*] to bypass the zone.

"B" appears on the display to indicate the zone is bypassed. If a zone is open, "O" appears on the display. When an open zone is bypassed, the "O" is replaced by "B."

5. To clear a bypassed zone, repeat the above procedure. The "B" disappears from the display indicating that the zone is no longer bypassed.

6. To exit bypass mode and return to the ready state, press [#].

## **Bypassing zones with a LED/ICON keypad:**

1. Ensure the system is disarmed.

- 2. Press [*][1], then enter your access code (if required).
- 3. Enter the three-digit number of the zone(s) to be bypassed. The zone light turns on to indicate that the zone is bypassed.

4. To clear a bypassed zone, repeat the above procedure. On LED keypads, the zone light turns off to indicate that the zone is no longer bypassed.

- 5. To exit bypass mode and return to the ready state, press [#].
**Note:** LED Keypads display the bypass status of zones 1-16 only.

## **Other Bypass Features:**

The following features are also available on the [*][1] zone bypass menu:

#### **Bypass Open Zones**

Displays all currently open or bypassed zones. Use the scroll keys to view zones. Open zones are indicated by an (O). To bypass a zone, press [*]. A bypassed zone is indicated by a (B).

**Note:** Zones with tampers or faults must be manually bypassed.

#### **Bypass Group**

Displays a programmed group of zones (bypass group) commonly bypassed. Press [*] to bypass all zones in the group.

#### **Program Bypass Group**

To program a bypass group, bypass all desired zones then select Bypass Options > Program Bypass Group. The selected zones are saved to the bypass group. When finished, press [#] to exit.

In order to program a bypass group, a master or supervisor code with access to the appropriate partition must be used.

### **Bypass Recall**

Press [*] while in this menu to bypass the same group of zones that were bypassed the last time the partition was armed.

#### **Clear Bypasses**

Press [*] to clear all bypasses.

**Shortcuts from the [*][1] base menu:**

991 = bypass group

995 = program group 1

998 = bypass open zones

999 = bypass recall

000 = clear group

## **When The Alarm System is Armed**

When the system is armed, pressing [*][1] toggles between stay, away or night arming. If a night zone is on the system, pressing [*][1] either prompts the user for an access code if required, or sounds an acknowledgment tone and changes the arming mode.

**Note:** If section [022], Option 5 [Stay/Away Toggle] is on, the system does not change from Away to Stay mode.

The zone attribute for zone bypassing must be enabled (see section [002] Zone Attributes, Option 04).

Holdup zones should not be part of bypass groups.

A zone that is manually bypassed via [*][1] will bypass the alarm, fault, and tamper conditions when DEOL is used.

If a 24-hour zone is bypassed, ensure that the zone is restored or disabled before removing the bypass.

# **4.7.2 [*][2] Trouble Display**

This feature is used to view system troubles. If a trouble is present, the keypad Trouble indicator illuminates and an audible indication is emitted (two short beeps every 10 seconds, except while in AC failure). Silence the audible indicator by pressing [#].

Troubles may be viewed while the system is armed or disarmed. The system may be programmed to show all troubles while armed or only fire troubles. See section [13] option 3 on page 86 for details.

+ If section [020] option 7 is on, a user must enter [*][6][Master Code][05] to give the installer permission to access programming.

* Can only change master code if section [015] option 6 is off.

** Yes if [023] option 8 is on.

The Installer and Master codes are system codes. They can be changed but not deleted. The other codes are user-defined and can be added or deleted as necessary. By default, access codes have the same partition and attribute programming as the code used to program them.

Access codes are either 4 or 6 digits in length, depending on the setting of programming section [041]. Duplicate codes are not valid.

## **Installer Code**

EN

EN

This code provides access to Installer Programming [*][8]. The installer code can access all partitions and perform any keypad function. This code can be programed by the installer in section [006][001]. The default is 5555 (4-digit) or 555555 (6-digit).

**Note:** For EN50131-1 approved installations the installer code cannot change the master code or any other level 3 codes. Attempting to access the master code from the installers code generates an error tone from the system.

## **Master Code - Access Code [01]**

By default the master code can access all partitions and can perform any keypad function. This code can be used to program all access codes, including the supervisor and duress codes.

If section [015] option 6 is on, the master code can only be changed by the installer via Installer Programming.

The default is 1234 (4-digit) or 123456 (6-digit).

The master code can be returned to factory default settings using Installer Programming section [989].

## **Maintenance Code**

The maintenance code can only be used to arm and disarm the system. It cannot bypass zones. Use [*][9] to arm the system, cancel auto-arming, or perform [*][7] command functions. No arm/disarm bell squawks are sounded when the maintenance code is used. The Maintenance code can be programed by the installer in programming section [006][003]. The default is AAAAAA.

## **User Codes - Access Codes [02] to [95]**

This type of access code is used to arm and disarm assigned partitions and perform other functions as programmed. It can access the [*][6] menu if programming option [023] option 8 is on. This code cannot access the [*][5] and [*][8] menus.

User access codes are created by the master user or supervisor users.

## **Supervisor Codes - Access Codes [02] to [95]**

A supervisor code is a user code with the Supervisor attribute enabled. Users with this attribute can access the [*][5] and [*] [6] user code programming section for the partition they are assigned to. However, these codes can only program codes which have equal or lesser attributes. These attributes are changeable via the [*][5] menu. A supervisor code is created by the master user or other supervisor users.

## **Duress Codes - Access Codes [02] to [95]**

Duress codes function the same as user access codes, except they transmit a duress reporting code when used to perform any function on the system.

Duress codes cannot be used to access [*][5], [*][6] or [*][8] menus.

Duress codes are created by the master user or supervisor users.

**Note:** Section [019] option 6 must be on to select the Duress Codes attribute.

## **One Time Use Code**

A one time use code is a user code with the One Time User attribute enabled. This access code enables the user to arm the alarm system an unlimited number of times. However, a user with this code can only disarm the system once per day. The ability to disarm is reset at midnight or when the one time user code is keyed in by the master code user.

**Note:** One time use code cannot be applied to wireless keys.

- 1. Connect AC Wiring.
In a new installation, the backup battery requires 24 Hrs. charging. AC Power is required for PC-Link Programming until the battery is charged.

- 2. Plug the PC-Link header into the alarm controller. A DLS session is initiated on the DLS computer.
- 3. When the session is complete, remove the PC-Link cable from the alarm controller.
- 4. Complete the installation.

## **Remote Programming**

DLS programming can be performed remotely by connecting to the alarm system via telephone line, cellular network or Ethernet.

Refer to Refer to "[401] DLS/SA Options" on page 113. for details.

**Note:** AC Power must be present for the alarm system to answer incoming calls from DLS.

# **5.2.3 Installer Programming**

Installer Programming is used to manually program alarm system options. Access this mode by keying in [*][8][Installer Code]. Use the scroll keys to navigate through the menus or jump directly to a specific section by keying in a section number.

Programming consists of toggling on and off options in each section or by populating data fields. For descriptions of all programming options, see "Programming Descriptions" on page 61.

# **5.2.4 Viewing Programming**

Programming sections can be viewed from any system keypad. The method for viewing and selecting programming options using LCD, LED and ICON keypads depends on the keypad type used. See below for specific instructions on programming with each keypad type.

Generally, programming options are accessed in the following way:

- 1. Enter Installer Programming mode ([*][8]).
- 2. Navigate to a specific programming section.

3. Select an option to view or change its programming.

All programming options are numbered and can be accessed by navigating through the menu (LCD) or by keying in the program section number. For toggle options, the name of the option is displayed (LCD) or LEDs 1-8 are illuminated (LED and ICON).

Use the keypad numbers to toggle options on or off. Sections requiring data input, such as phone numbers, display the full data in fields up to 32 characters long (LCD). To input data, use the scroll keys to select a character then press the keypad button corresponding to the number/letter required. Scroll to the next character and repeat the procedure as needed. Press the [#] key to save changes and exit the program section.

The programming worksheets and descriptions later in this section provide a place to record custom programming settings and are numerically listed to assist in locating specific sections.

## **Keypad Types**

The sections below describe how programming is viewed and interpreted using each of the supported keypad types. For more information on each keypad type, see the instruction sheet included with the keypad.

#### **LED and ICON**

Both of these keypads use LEDs to communicate information. The programming icon illuminates to indicate the alarm system is in Installer Programming mode. The Armed light turns off and the Ready light turns on while in a programming section.

Programming sections fall under two categories: those that require options to be "toggled" on or off, and those that require data to be keyed in.

Toggle options are indicated across the top of the display using zone numbers 1-8. For example, if options 1 and 4 are on, the display appears as follows on the different keypads:

![](_page_58_Figure_11.jpeg)

## **Figure 5-1 LED and ICON displays**

To enable or disable a toggle option, press the number key on the keypad corresponding to the option.

Sections requiring data input, such as phone numbers, display information in a binary format using zone LEDs 1-4 as described in the following chart:

![](_page_58_Figure_15.jpeg)

## **Figure 5-2**

When a section is entered, the keypad immediately displays the first digit of information programmed. Using the example in Figure 5 above, if zone 1 and 4 are illuminated, the first programmed digit in the section is 9. Use the scroll key [>] to advance to the next digit.

For sections that require multiple two or three-digit numbers, the keypad beeps three times after each entry and moves to the next item on the list. After the last digit in the section is entered, the keypad beeps rapidly eight times and exits the programming section. The Ready light turns off and the Armed light turns on.

To exit programming at any time, press the [#] key. All changes made up to that point are saved.

#### **LCD Keypad**

LCD keypads use a full-message display that provides visual and numerical navigation through the programming sections. The Armed light illuminates when Installer Programming mode is activated. Use the scroll keys to move through menu options and press [*] to select. Alternatively, enter a specific section number. The Armed light flashes to indicate a sub-section has been selected. Press [*] to select a sub-section. The Ready light illuminates and the information programmed in the section is displayed.

For programming sections with toggle options, press the corresponding number on the keypad to turn the option on or off. The display changes accordingly.

Sections requiring data input, such as phone numbers, display the full data in fields up to 32 characters long.

To input data, use the scroll keys to select a character then press the keypad button corresponding to the number/letter required. Scroll to the next character and repeat the procedure as needed.

For information on entering HEX data, see below.

A 2-second error tone is sounded if an invalid key is pressed.

Press the [#] key to exit the program section at any time. All changes made up to that point are saved.

# **5.2.5 Programming Hex and Decimal Data**

Hexadecimal (HEX) digits may be required during programming. To program a HEX digit, press the [*] key while in a programming section that requires a data entry. HEX programming mode activates and the Ready light begins to flash.

The following table indicates which number should be pressed to enter the corresponding HEX digit:

## **Table 5-2 HEX Digit Programming**

| Value   | Enter           | Telephone Dialer  |
|---------|-----------------|-------------------|
| HEX [A] | Press [*][1][*] | Not supported     |
| HEX [B] | Press [*][2][*] | Simulated [*] key |
| HEX [C] | Press [*][3][*] | Simulated [#] key |
| HEX [D] | Press [*][4][*] | Dial tone search  |
| HEX [E] | Press [*][5][*] | Two-second pause  |
| HEX [F] | Press [*][6][*] | End of number     |

The Ready light continues to flash after the HEX digit is entered. If another HEX digit is required press the corresponding number. If a decimal digit is required, press the [*] key again. The Ready light illuminates and the panel returns to regular decimal programming.

Example: To enter 'C1' for a closing by user 1, enter [*] [3] [*], [1]

[*] to enter hexadecimal mode (Ready light flashes)

[3] to enter C

[*] to return to decimal mode (Ready light is on)

[1] to enter digit 1

If an error is made while inputting data, press the [#] key to exit the section. Select that section again and re-enter the information correctly.

When using a Contact ID format, a decimal zero [0] does not transmit for account and reporting codes. Programming a zero [0] tells the alarm system not to send any pulses for that digit. Decimal zero [0] is a filler digit. To make a zero [0] transmit, it must be programmed as a Hexadecimal 'A.'

Example: For the 4-digit account number '4032', enter [4] [*] [1] [*] [3], [2].

[4] to enter the digit 4

[*] to enter Hexadecimal mode (Ready light flashes)

[1] to enter A

[*] to return to decimal mode (Ready light is solid)

[3] to enter the digit 3

[2] to enter the digit 2

# **5.3.2 Zone Setup**

The following section describes zone programming options. To program a zone type, first enter section [001] and then enter a 3 digit zone number from 001 - 128. After entering a new zone type for the desired zone number, the keypad will automatically advance to the next zone.

## **[001] Zone Types**

A zone type defines how a zone operates within the system and how it responds when triggered.

#### [001]-[128] Select Zone

Every zone on the system must be assigned a zone type. The available zone types are listed below.

#### **000** *–* **Null Zone**

Assign to all unused zones.

#### **001** *–* **Delay 1**

Commonly assigned to primary points of entry. Follows entry delay 1 and exit delay timers (section [005]). Arming the alarm system starts the exit delay timer. After the exit delay has expired, opening the door starts the entry delay timer. During entry delay, the keypad buzzer prompts the user to disarm the system.

#### **002** *–* **Delay 2**

Commonly assigned to secondary points of entry (further from the keypad). Follows entry delay 2 timer (section [005]).

#### **003** *–* **Instant**

Commonly used for perimeter doors and windows, this zone type follows the exit delay. The alarm is triggered instantly if the zone is tripped after the exit delay expires.

#### **004** *–* **Interior**

Commonly assigned to interior motion sensors near a point of entry, such as a foyer or hallway, that must be accessed to reach the keypad. The alarm is activated if the system is armed and a delay type zone (e.g., front door) is not tripped first, or if the entry/exit timer expires before the alarm is disarmed. Otherwise, the zone is instant if tripped.

#### **005** *–* **Interior Stay/Away**

Similar to Interior zone type except that the system bypasses the zone when armed in Stay mode. Commonly used to activate perimeter zones while permitting free movement throughout the interior.

#### **006** *–* **Delay Stay/Away**

Similar to delay 1 except that the zone is bypassed when armed in Stay mode. Commonly used with motion detectors that cover an entry point.

#### **007** *–* **Delayed 24-Hour Fire**

This zone is used with smoke detectors and functions similar to the standard fire zone, except the communicator delays the alarm memory and transmission by 30 seconds. If the alarm is acknowledged by pressing any key, the siren is silenced and the transmission aborted. If the smoke detector is not restored after the alarm has been acknowledged, the siren output activates after 90 seconds and another 30-second delay starts. A code is required to silence the alarm. A tamper or fault causes a fire trouble to log and transmit.

**Note:** The supervision options (NC, EOL, DEOL) do not affect the functionality of this zone. The restored state of this zone type is 5k6, the alarm state is short and the trouble state is open.

#### **008** *–* **Standard 24-Hour Fire**

This zone is used with smoke detectors. The siren sounds instantly when the smoke detector is activated. If enabled, the communicator immediately transmits the alarm to the monitoring station. A tamper or fault of this zone type causes a fire trouble to log and transmit.

**Note:** The supervision options (NC, EOL, DEOL) do not affect the functionality of this zone. The restored state of this zone type is 5.6k, the alarm state is short and the trouble state is open.

#### **009** *–* **Instant Stay/Away**

Commonly assigned to interior motion sensors. This zone type is bypassed when armed in Stay mode, but functions like an Instant zone [003] when armed in Away mode.

#### **010** *–* **Interior Delay**

Commonly assigned to interior motion sensors. When Away armed, this zone type functions like the Interior zone type. When Stay or night armed, tripping the zone activates entry delay 1. Tripping this zone during exit delay does not cause the system to arm in Away mode, as tripping a regular Delay type zone does.

#### **011** *–* **Day Zone**

Commonly used in areas where immediate notification of entry is desired. When disarmed, tripping this zone activates the keypad buzzer but does not log or report the event. When armed, tripping this zone activates the siren then logs and reports the event.

**Note:** An alarm during exit delay causes the siren to activate and remain on when exit delay expires.

#### **012** *–* **Night Zone**

Commonly assigned to interior motion detectors in areas accessed during the night. This zone functions like an Interior Stay/Away zone [005] when armed using any method except the following: If Stay armed, this zone is bypassed; if armed using [*][1], this zone is bypassed.

#### **016** *–* **Final Door Set (Non CP-01 panels only)**

This zone type does not use an exit timer (infinite exit delay). The door must be opened then closed to complete the arming sequence. The arming method determines if infinite exit delay is applied. See the table below.

**Note:** Disable Exit Delay Termination with this zone type.

If this zone type is bypassed, the alarm system cannot be Away armed.

| Arming Method     | Infinite Exit Delay | Arming Mode |
|-------------------|---------------------|-------------|
| User Code         | Y                   | Away        |
| Keyswitch         | Y                   | Away        |
| Away Key          | Y                   | Away        |
| Wireless Key Away | Y                   | Away        |
| *0 Arm            | Y                   | Away        |
| *9 Arm            | N                   | Stay        |
| Stay Key          | N                   | Stay        |
| Wireless Key Stay | N                   | Stay        |
| Remote Access/SMS | -                   | Do Not Use  |
| DLS Arm           | N                   | Away        |
| NAA Arming        | N                   | Away        |

**Note:** When Troubles/Open Zones Cancel Arming is enabled with this zone, any troubles or open zones on the system cancel arming when the zone is tripped and restored.

Due to the potential energy requirements of infinite exit delay, wireless keypads MUST be powered by a transformer.

If a wireless key is used to away arm the system, the door must still be opened then closed to complete the arming sequence. The indoor siren will activate until the exit delay has expired.

#### **017** *–* **24-Hour Burglary**

This zone type is active at all times. It reports an alarm if the alarm system is armed or disarmed. This zone type sounds the siren for the length of Bell time-out if the audible attribute is enabled.

#### **018 – 24-Hour Bell/Buzzer**

When the alarm system is armed and this type of zone is tripped, the siren activates for the duration of the bell time-out. If the alarm system is disarmed when this type of zone is tripped, the keypad buzzer activates until an access code is entered.

#### **023** *–* **24-Hour Supervisory**

This zone is active and reports alarms at all times when tripped. The siren and keypad buzzer do not activate.

**Note:** The supervision options (NC, EOL, DEOL) do not affect the functionality of this zone. The restored state of this zone type is 5.6k, the alarm state is short and the trouble state is open. For use with normally open contacts.

#### **024** *–* **24-Hour Supervisory Buzzer**

When tripped, the keypad buzzer emits a steady tone until a valid access code is entered.

#### **025** *–* **Auto Verify Fire**

(Hardwired smoke detectors)

When the zone is activated, a 30-second delay begins but no fire alarm sounds. If the same zone is activated again up to 60 seconds after the delay expires, the alarm is triggered immediately. If the same zone is activated after 60 seconds, the entire sequence begins again.

If a second fire zone is violated during the auto-verify sequence, both zones a fire alarm is immediately triggered.

(Wireless smoke detectors)

When the zone is activated, a 40-second delay begins. The alarm is triggered if the zone is still faulted after 30 seconds. If the zone is no longer in alarm, an 80-second verification timer begins. If any fire zone is activated during this period, the alarm is triggered.

If another fire zone is activated during the auto verify sequence, both zones go into alarm immediately.

**Note:** Wireless smoke detectors used with this zone type must have a built in siren to act as a pre-alert to the system alarm.

**Note:** The supervision options (NC, EOL, DEOL) do not affect the functionality of this zone. The restored state of this zone type is 5.6kΩ, the alarm state is short and the trouble state is open.

#### **027** *–* **Fire Supervisory**

When this zone is tripped, the keypad buzzer activates and a supervisory alarm is sent to the monitoring station. A valid access code must be entered to silence the buzzer.

**Note:** The supervision options (NC, EOL, DEOL) do not affect the functionality of this zone. The restored state of this zone type is 5.6k, the alarm state is short and the trouble state is open.

#### **040** *–* **24-Hour Gas**

Instant alarm when activated, audible alarm at default.This zone type may be assigned to any device type.

#### **041** *–* **24-Hour CO**

This zone type is used with CO detectors. In the event of an alarm, a distinctive siren cadence is sounded. This is followed by a 5-second pause and then repeated. After 4 minutes, the 5-second pause is extended to 60 seconds; however, BTO must be programmed with a value of 5 minutes or higher. The siren is silenced when an access code is entered or the siren times out.

**Note:** The supervision options (NC, EOL, DEOL) do not affect the functionality of this zone. The restored state of this zone type is 5k6, the alarm state is short and the trouble state is open. For use with normally open contacts.

#### **042** *–* **24-Hour Holdup**

Instant alarm when activated, silent alarm at default.

**Note:** Not for use in UL listed installations.

#### **043** *–* **24-Hour Panic**

Instant alarm when activated, audible alarm at default.

#### **045** *–* **24-Hour Heat**

Instant alarm when activated, audible alarm at default.

**Note:** For use with normally closed contacts.

#### **046** *–* **24-Hour Medical**

Instant alarm when activated, audible alarm at default.

#### **047** *–* **24-Hour Emergency**

Instant alarm when activated, audible alarm at default.

#### **048** *–* **24-Hour Sprinkler**

Instant alarm when activated, audible alarm at default.

#### **049** *–* **24-Hour Flood**

Instant alarm when activated, audible alarm at default.

#### **051** *–* **24-Hour Latching Tamper**

Instant alarm when activated, audible alarm at default. The alarm system cannot be armed until Installer Programming is entered after the zone is restored.

#### **052** *–* **24-Hour Non-Alarm**

This zone is active at all times but does not cause an alarm. Zone attributes such as Zone Bypassing and Door Chime affect the functionality of this zone. This zone type can also be assigned to a temperature sensor if indoor/outdoor temperature display is required without temperature warnings or alarm conditions.

#### **056** *–***24 Hour High Temperature**

This zone type is used with temperature sensors and is activated when the temperature rises above a programmed threshold (set in section [804][xxx][019-020]). Instant alarm when activated, audible alarm at default. This zone type generates an alarm when the system is armed or disarmed.

**Note:** The temperature threshold includes a 3 °C (5-6 °F) difference between a given state and its restored condition. For example, an alarm at 6 °C is restored at 3°C (High temperature) or 9°C (Low temperature), depending upon the zone type selected.

The zone type for temperature sensors must be 24 Hour High/Low Temperature in order for the sensor to operate properly.

#### **057** *–***24 Hour Low Temperature**

This zone type is used with temperature sensors and is activated when the temperature drops below a programmed threshold (set in section [804][xxx][019-020]). Instant alarm when activated, audible alarm at default. This zone type generates an alarm when the system is armed or disarmed.

#### **060** *–* **24-Hour Non-Latching Tamper**

This zone is always active and reports a tamper condition with no audible alarm when opened or tamper/faulted.

#### **066** *–* **Momentary Keyswitch Arm**

Often used with a keyswitch module*, turning the key alternately arms and disarms the system and silences the alarms. Tampers and faults only initiate their respective trouble sequence. The keypad gives no indication when this zone type is activated.

**Note:** With audible alarm active, using the keyswitch when disarmed is the same as entering an access code at the keypad. Using the keyswitch during the first 30 seconds of a delayed fire alarm is the same as pressing a key at the keypad (the 90 second delay starts). Activation of a keyswitch zone arms or disarms the system. Activation of this zone type is NOT logged nor is the Police code transmitted. Bypassed zones of this type are not un-bypassed when the system is disarmed. When the zone is bypassed, a zone bypass event buffer log and communication occurs immediately, NOT when the system is armed.

*Keyswitch module not for use in UL/ULC listed installations.

#### **067** *–* **Maintained Keyswitch Arm**

Often used with a keyswitch module, turning the key (open state) arms the system. Turning the key back (restored state) disarms the system. Tampers and faults only initiate their respective trouble sequence.

**Note:** DO NOT use for wireless zones. Activation of the zone does not log or transmit the Police code. Bypassed zones of this type are not un-bypassed when the system is disarmed. When the zone is bypassed, a zone bypass event buffer log and communication occurs immediately, NOT when the system is armed.

With an audible alarm active, using the keyswitch when disarmed is the same as entering an access code at the keypad. Activating this zone type during the first 30 seconds of a delayed fire alarm is the same as pressing a key at the keypad (the 90 second delay starts). If left in the open state, the system does not arm until the zone is restored and tripped again.

#### **068** *–* **Momentary Keyswitch Disarm**

Use with a keyswitch module. Activating and restoring this zone disarms the partition and silences alarms. Tampers or faults do not disarm the zone.

**Note:** Do not use as a global zone.

#### **069** *–* **Maintained Keyswitch Disarm**

Used with a maintained keyswitch. Activating this zone disarms the partition.

Tampers or faults on this zone do not disarm the partition.

#### **071** *–* **Doorbell Zone**

This zone type sounds a chime through keypads on the partition when activated. No alarms are generated. Various chime tones can be programmed. Disabling door chime on the partition also disables the chime on this zone.

**Note:** Do not use as a global zone.

#### **072** *–* **Push to Set (Non CP-01 panels only)**

Activating this zone starts an infinite exit delay when armed according to the methods described in the table below. To complete the arming sequence, this zone must be activated and restored. Once done, the exit delay timer starts.

| Arming Method     | Infinite Exit Delay | Arming Mode |
|-------------------|---------------------|-------------|
| User Code         | Y                   | Away        |
| Keyswitch         | Y                   | Away        |
| Away Key          | Y                   | Away        |
| *0 Arm            | Y                   | Away        |
| *9 Arm            | N                   | Stay        |
| Stay Key          | N                   | Stay        |
| Night Key         | N                   | Night       |
| Remote Access/SMS | -                   | Do Not Use  |
| DLS Arm           | N                   | Away        |
| NAA Arming        | N                   | Away        |

Do not use exit delay termination with this zone type. Away arming with this zone bypassed prevents arming.

## **[002] Zone Attributes**

Zone attributes are used to customize the operation of zones. When a zone type (section [001]) is programmed, the default zone attribute is automatically assigned.

When programming attributes using LED/ICON keypads:

- l Ready light ON: Program attributes [1-8]
- l Ready light and Armed light ON: Program attribute [9-16] (press [1] for option 9, press [6] for option 14 etc.)
- l Press [9] to switch between attributes [1-8] and attributes [9-16].

**Note:** These attributes override default settings. Do NOT change fire zone attributes from their default settings.

#### **[001]-[128] Select Zone**

The attributes listed below can be enabled and disabled for each zone.

#### **01** *–* **Bell Audible**

ON: An alarm activates the siren.

OFF: Silent alarm.

#### **02** *–* **Bell Steady**

ON: Siren output is steady when in alarm.

OFF: Siren output pulses when in alarm.

#### **03** *–* **Door Chime**

ON: The keypad chimes when the zone is open and when the zone is secured.

OFF: The zone does not chime.

#### **04** *–* **Bypass Enabled**

ON: The zone can be manually bypassed.

OFF: The zone cannot be bypassed.

#### **05** *–* **Force Arm**

EN

ON: The system can be armed with the zone open. The zone is temporarily bypassed and, when secured, is monitored by the system.

ON: When open zones cancel arming is enabled [021][7], the system can begin arming with an open, force armable zone, but if the zone is still open when the exit delay timer expires, the arming will be cancelled.

OFF: The system cannot be armed if the zone is open.

#### **06** *–* **Swinger Shut Down**

ON: When the zone goes into alarm for the number of times programmed in the Swinger Shutdown Counter ( [377] Communication Variables), it shuts down with no further transmissions sent to the monitoring station. The siren follows swinger shutdown if programmed.

OFF: Swinger shutdown is disabled. All alarms are transmitted.

#### **07** *–* **Transmission Delay**

ON: Reporting of zone alarms is delayed for the programmed time in section 377 (See "[377] Communication Variables" on page 107). If a valid access code is entered within this time, no alarm signal is communicated.

OFF: When an alarm occurs, the reporting code is transmitted immediately.

#### **08** *–* **Burglary Verification**

ON: Enabled for cross zoning/police code. Zone alarms are not communicated until a burglary verified event occurs.

OFF: Not enabled for cross zoning/police code.

#### **09** *–* **Normally Closed (NC)**

ON: The zone requires a normally closed loop.

OFF: The zone follows programming in section [013] option 2.

See note after option 11.

#### **10** *–* **Single End of Line (SEOL) Resistors**

ON: The zone requires a single end-of-line resistor (5.6K).

OFF: The zone follows programming in section [013] option 2.

See note after option 11.

#### **11** *–* **Double End of Line (DEOL)**

ON: The zone requires two end-of-line resistors (5.6K).

OFF: The zone follows programming in section [013] option 2.

**Note:** If more than 1 option is enabled for options 09, 10, and 11 the lowest attribute number takes precedence. If options 09 and 10 are both enabled the zone follows the normally closed loop configuration.

#### **12** *–* **Fast Loop/Normal Loop Response**

ON: Follows a fast loop response of 50ms.

OFF: Follows a normal loop response as programmed in the Zone Loop Response Time section.

#### **13** *–* **2-Way Audio Attribute**

ON: Panel is able to initiate a 2 way audio session.

OFF: Only the microphone turns on, initiating a a Listen-in only session. The speaker remains off.

#### **14** *–* **Hold Up Verification**

ON: An alarm from zones of this type can contribute to a verified hold up alarm. Use this attribute with Panic and Hold Up zones.

OFF: An alarm from zones of this type does not contribute to a verified hold up alarm. The zone does not cause the hold up verification timer to start counting down, or generate a verified hold up if the alarm is detected while the timer is running.

# **5.3.3 System Times**

This section describes how to program various timers applicable to the entire alarm system.

#### **[005] System Times**

This is the base menu used by installers to program timers, including system area [000], partition timers [001]-[008], and daylight saving time [901]/[902].

## **[000] – System Area**

#### **Bell Cutoff Time**

System sirens follow this timer. Fire alarms follow this timer if section [014] option 8 (Fire Bell Continues Option) is off. System tampers follow this timer. The bell cutoff time is programmed in minutes. Valid entries are 001 to 255 minutes.

Keypad buzzer alarms do not follow this timer.

#### **Bell Delay Time**

The Bell Delay Timer determines how long the bell will be delayed after a zone alarm event. Valid entries are 000-255 where 000 disables this feature.

#### **Burglary Verification Timer**

If another zone with the Burglary Verification attribute enabled is violated within the duration of this timer, a burglary verified event is communicated and logged. "Burglary Verified" is displayed on the keypad when the system is disarmed.

The burglary verification timer is programmed in minutes. Valid entries are 000 to 255 minutes.

#### **Holdup Verification Timer**

A holdup alarm is immediately communicated to the monitoring station and the holdup verification timer starts. A programmable counter determines the number of additional holdup events that must occur before the timer expires to create a verified holdup event. Once this happens, the holdup event is logged and communicated.

**Note:** Not for use with UL/ULC listed installations. 000 disables this feature.

#### **Zone Loop Response Time**

Loop response time is a 3- digit entry from 005 to 255 programmed in 10ms increments. The minimum available loop response time is 50ms (e.g., program 005 for 50ms).

#### **Automatic Clock Adjust**

This value adds or subtracts seconds from the system clock at the end of each day to compensate for inaccuracies. To determine the adjustment value, monitor the time lost or gained by the alarm system over a period of time and calculate the average gains or loses.

Example #1: The clock loses an average of 9 seconds per day. Program the alarm controller to adjust the clock by 51 seconds for the last minute of each day. This speeds up the alarm controller's clock by 9 seconds, correcting the problem.

Example #2: The clock gains an average of 11 seconds per day. Program the alarm controller to adjust the clock by 71 seconds for the last minute of each day. This slows down the alarm controller's clock by 11 seconds, correcting the problem.

If the Auto-arm time is set for 23:59, any change to the Clock Adjust option will directly affect the Auto-arm pre-alert time.

## **[001]-[008] Partition 1-8 Timers**

The following timers can be applied to each partition.

**Note:** For UL installations, the Entry Delay plus the Communications Delay must not exceed 60 seconds.

#### **Entry Delay 1:**

This value determines the entry delay time for delay 1 type zones. Valid entries are 001 to 255 seconds.

### **Entry Delay 2:**

This value determines the entry delay time for delay 2 type zones. Valid entries are 001 to 255 seconds.

**Note:** The system follows the entry timer that activates first.

#### **Exit Delay:**

This value determines the exit delay time when arming the system. During exit delay, both the Ready and Armed LEDs are on. When the exit delay expires, both LEDs turn off.

![](_page_69_Picture_34.jpeg)

**Note:** European products will only activate the armed LED at the end of exit delay.

### **Settle Delay:**

This timer enables a programmable, short duration bypass of all zones on the partition at the time of arming. It allows motion detectors to restore when the system is armed to help prevent false alarms.

The typical value for this timer is 5 seconds, but can be increased if false alarms persist. Program 000 for no settle delay.

The settle delay duration is programmed in seconds. Valid entries are 000 to 010 seconds.

## **[900] – Bell Delay Partition Mask**

This option enables or disables the Bell Delay feature for individual partitions. When the option is enabled, Bell Delay is applied to the selected partition during alarm conditions. When the option is disabled, Bell Delay is not applied. The default setting is (Y): enabled.

## **[901]/[902] – Daylight Savings Begin/End**

### **Daylight Begin [001] and Daylight End [002]:**

Set the date and time daylight savings starts and ends.

#### **Month**

Valid entries are 001-012 (January to December).

### **Hour**

EN

Valid entries are 00-23 hours. This is the time of day to advance or turn the clock back.

#### **Increment**

Valid entries are 1 or 2 hours. This is the number of hours to advance or turn the clock back.

# **5.3.4 Access Codes**

This section is used by installers to program the installer code, the master code and the maintenance code. For information on programming other access codes, see "[*][5] Program Access Codes" on page 47.

## **[006] Installer Defined Access Codes**

This is the base menu used by installers to program the installer code [001], the master code [002] and the maintenance code [003]. See below for details.

#### **[001] – Installer Code**

This code is used by the installer to gain access to Installer Programming [*][8]. Users with this access code have access to all levels of system programming.

**Note:** For EN50131-1 approved installations the installer code cannot change the master code or any other level 3 codes.

#### **[002] – Master Code**

This code is used by the master user, a person designated to perform operational tasks beyond those of the standard user. The master code provides access to functionality in the [*][5] and [*][6] menus.

#### **[003] – Maintenance Code**

This code is usually assigned temporarily to maintenance personnel who must deactivate the alarm to enter the premises. The maintenance code can arm and disarm the system, but does not grant access to any other functionality.

# **5.3.5 [007] - [008] PGM Configuration**

This section describes how to set up and configure programmable outputs.

PGMs are used to send electrical current to external devices such as lights and sirens, usually when an alarm event occurs. The alarm controller provides up to three 50mA PGMs and one 300mA PGM. PGM outputs can be expanded using the optional 8-output expander (HSM2208) and the 4 high-current output expander (HSM2204).

Programming an output is a four-step process:

- 1. Program the PGM
- 2. Assign the PGM to a partition.
- 3. Assign an output attribute.
- 4. Assign an output option.

Refer to See "[011] PGM Configuration Options" on page 85 for PGM slot alignment.

## **[007] PGM Programming**

This is the base menu used by the installer to assign PGMs to the main bell and a partition.

#### **[000] Main Bell Partition Assignment**

This programming section is used to define which partitions activate the main bell when they go into alarm. All partitions are selected by default.

#### **[001]-[164] PGM Partition Assignment**

This option enables the installer to assign each PGM output to a partition. To assign a PGM to a partition, first select the PGM output (PGM 001-164), then select the partition (1-8).

**Note:** This field is only supported by PGM types that have multiple partition capabilities (e.g., command outputs, away arming). It does not affect system outputs (e.g., ground start pulse).

## **[008] PGM Timer Programming**

### **[000] PGM Minutes/Seconds**

This option determines if the timer is in minutes or seconds.

#### **[001]-[164] PGM Timer**

This timer programs the duration (in seconds or minutes) that PGMs 1-164 activate if programmed to follow the PGM Timer.

Select option 001-164 for PGM 1-164.

This option does not affect outputs programmed as Sensor Reset.

# **5.3.6 [009] PGM Types**

The output types described in this section can be assigned to alarm controller and output expander module PGMs. Each alarm controller supports up to 2 or 4 PGMs and can be expanded using HSM2208 output expander and HSM2204 High-Current output modulemodules. PGM attributes are defined in section "[010] PGM Attributes" on page 77.

#### **[001]-[164] Select PGM**

## **100 – Null PGM**

This option deactivates the PGM output

## **101 – Burglary and Fire Bell Follower**

This PGM output follows:

- l Fire pre-alerts
- l Temporal three fire signal (if enabled)
- l All audible burglary and fire alarms by partition
- l Bell cut-off time
- l Bell squawk conditions
- l Audible exit fault

This output activates when the alarm output is active and turns off when the alarm output is silenced. The siren pattern matches the programmed cadence for the zone that went into alarm. Cadence priority is as follows:

- l fire alarm cadence
- l CO alarm cadence
- l other alarm cadences

The main siren still activates for all alarms.

## **102 – Delayed Fire and Burglary**

This output type operates the same as the Burglary and Fire Bell Follower (PGM type 01), but does not activate until the transmission delay time expires.

When a zone with transmission delay enabled is tripped, the Bell, Regular Fire and Burglary PGMs activate. At the end of the transmission delay, the delayed Fire and Burglary output activates.

This PGM is usually used to control outdoor sirens. If a false alarm occurs, the user has time to disarm the system before the external sirens activate.

**Note:** If a zone alarm occurs but does not follow transmission delay, this PGM activates immediately, even if transmission delay is active for a different zone alarm.

This output activates for audible exit fault and does not interfere with the operation of any other programmable output.

## **103 – Sensor Reset [*][7][2]**

This output is normally active and deactivates for 5 seconds when a [*][7][2] fire reset command is entered or when an auto verified fire alarm is detected. This option is used to reset power for latching smoke detectors. The keypad buzzer does not sound for the 5-second period. See "Smoke Detector Wiring" on page 24 for instructions on wiring smoke detectors.

## **104 – 2-Wire Smoke**

When this PGM is programmed, the onboard PGM functions as an input instead of an output. 2-wire smoke detectors can be connected to this input, which means that a zone input does not need to be used.

The PGM is also supervised, and a trouble condition is generated if a 2.2KΩ resistor is not present between the PGM terminal and Aux+.

The 2-wire smoke detector input creates an instant and latching alarm.

## **109 – Courtesy Pulse**

Courtesy pulse causes an output to activate for the entry and exit times, plus 2 minutes. This option is typically used to activate a courtesy light near the exit door for the duration of the entry/exit times.

## **111 – Keypad Buzzer Follow**

PGM output activates with the keypad buzzer when triggered by the events below. The PGM output remains active for the duration of the keypad buzzer.

- l 24-hour supervisory buzzer zone alarm
- l Auto-arm and no activity arming pre-alert.
- l No activity arm pre-alert
- l Entry delay
- l Audible exit fault
- l Audible exit delay
- l Door chime

This PGM type does not activate for local key presses or trouble beeps.

## **114 – Ready to Arm**

This PGM activates when the system is ready to arm (all non-force armed zones on the system are restored). The PGM output de-activates when an access code is entered to arm the system and the exit delay begins. This PGM operates as described during walk test mode (if all zones are restored).

## **115 – System Armed Status**

This output activates when all selected partitions are armed (end of the exit delay) in either Stay or Away modes. The output de-activates when the system is disarmed.

## **116 – Away Armed Status**

This PGM switches on when the system is armed with stay/away zones activated. If the system is armed with the stay/away zones always active, then the away output is active.

## **117 – Stay Armed Status**

This PGM output activates if the system is armed with the stay/away zones bypassed.

## **120 – Away Armed with No Zone Bypasses Status**

When assigned to a single partition, this PGM output activates when the system is armed with stay/away and night zones active, and no zones are bypassed.

If assigned to multiple partitions, all partitions must be armed in away mode with no bypassed zones before the PGM activates. If a force armable zone is violated at the time of arming, the PGM does not activate. When the zone is restored, the PGM activates.

## **121-124 – Command Outputs 1-4**

Command Outputs 1-4 are user-activated by entering [*] [7] [1-4] at any keypad. When an output is activated, three acknowledgment beeps are sounded.

PGM outputs of this type can be programmed to follow a pre-defined schedule (programmed in section "[601]-[604] Schedule Labels" on page 63). Even if the output follows a schedule it can be manually turned ON, OFF or follow the schedule through [*][7].

To select a schedule for these PGM outputs to follow, see "[009] PGM Types " on page 72

## **129 – Partition Status Alarm Memory**

This feature is intended to be used on a keyswitch plate, with a light controlled by this PGM to indicate system status. When the partition is armed, the output activates (steady) at the:

beginning of exit delay

end of exit delay.

NA

EN

UL

If an alarm occurs on the armed partition, the output flashes for the remainder of the armed period. If an alarm occurs on a disarmed partition (24 Hr Zone), the output flashes until the alarm is acknowledged.

This output will not activate during a walk test or for FMP key, holdup or audible/silent PGM2 input alarms.

#### **132 – Holdup Output**

When a Holdup zone (Type [042]) goes into alarm, this output activates until the partition is either armed (access code, keyswitch, [*][0], etc.) or disarmed. A tamper or fault on a holdup zone type does not activate this output. This output does not activate in Walk Test mode. If a global holdup alarm occurs, each partition with holdup zones assigned must be armed or disarmed before the holdup output deactivates. If holdup alarms occur on multiple partitions, an access code must be entered at each partition before the output deactivates.

**Note:** Not for use with UL/ULC listed installations.

## **134 – 24-Hour Silent Input (PGM 2)**

With this input the keypad does not indicate an alarm, the siren remains silent, and the signal is sent to the central station. This input does not follow swinger shutdown. A 2.2KΩ EOL resistor is required for this input (to Aux+). If a short or open occurs, an alarm is generated.

**Note:** Not for use with UL installations.

## **135 – 24-Hour Audible Input (PGM 2)**

LCD keypads indicate that the system is in alarm, the siren sounds for the duration of bell timeout, and the signal is sent to the central station. This input does not follow swinger shutdown. A 2.2KΩ EOL resistor is required for this input (to Aux+). If a short or open occurs, an alarm is generated for all partitions and sirens. PGM partition assignment does not affect this PGM type.

## **146 – TLM and Alarm**

This output activates when a telephone line fault condition is present AND an alarm occurs. The output remains active until an access code is entered to disarm or the TLM trouble is restored. The output activates for all audible and silent alarms (except duress) if a TLM trouble is present. If an alarm activates this output in the disarmed state, it will deactivate when the system is armed or the telephone line is restored. This output type also activates if alarms are in memory (not only for currently active alarms) when the TLM fault occurs. The alarms in memory must have exceeded the bell timeout.

## **147 – Kissoff**

This PGM output activates for two seconds after the alarm system receives a kissoff signal from the central station.

## **148 – Ground Start**

This output activates for two seconds before the alarm system attempts dialing to obtain a dial tone on Ground Start telephone equipment. Two 2-second pauses must be inserted at the beginning of the telephone number when using this option.

## **149 – Alternate Communicator**

This output can be used to trigger inputs on a third-party communicator for the purpose of triggering alarm communications to a monitoring station. This output can be programmed to activate when any of the following system events (alarms) occur on the system:

- l Fire (Fire Key, Fire Zones)
- l Panic (Panic Key and Panic Zones)
- l Burglary (Delay, Instant, Interior, Stay/Away and 24-hour Burglary Zones)
- l Opening/Closing Events
- l Zone Auto-Bypass. (Please see 08 Zone Auto-Bypass for details).
- l Medical (Medical Key, Medical and Emergency Zones)
- l Burglary Verified
- l Opening After Alarm
- l Emergency Alarm
- l Duress Alarm
- l Holdup Verified

In the armed state, this output deactivates when the system is disarmed. If an alarm activates this output in the disarmed state, the output deactivates if a valid access code is entered within the bell timeout or if the system is armed after the bell timeout has expired.

This output activates for silent and audible alarms or medical conditions only. It will not activate during pre-alert or delays.

**Note:** The PGM attributes for this option, programmed in section [010], differ from the standard selection of attributes normally programmed.

**Note:** When this PGM is configured to provide Opening/Closing status, the PGM must be programmed as a timed output, not latching.

## **155 – System Trouble**

This output can be programmed to activate when any of the following trouble conditions are present:

- l Service Required
- l Loss of Clock
- l DC Trouble
- l Bus Voltage
- l AC Trouble
- l Device Fault
- l Device Low Battery
- l Device Tamper
- l RF Delinquency
- l Module Supervisory
- l Module Tamper
- l Communications
- l Not Networked

This output deactivates when all of the selected trouble conditions are cleared.

## **156 – Latched System Event (Strobe)**

This output can be used to notify the home owner, before they enter the premises, that an alarm has occurred. This output can be programmed to activate when any of the following alarms occur on the system:

- l Burglary (Delay, Instant, Interior, Stay/Away and 24-Hour Burglary Zones)
- l Fire (Fire Key, Fire Zones)
- l Panic (Panic Key and Panic Zones)
- l Medical (Medical Key, Medical and Emergency Zones)
- l Supervisory (Supervisory, Freezer and Water Zones)
- l Priority (Gas, Heat, Sprinkler and 24-Hour Latching Zones)
- l Holdup (Holdup zones)
- l Output follows pulse timer (section "[008] PGM Timer Programming" on page 72).
- l Duress
- l Emergency
- l CO Alarm
- l Fire Supervisory
- l Fire trouble

This output does not activate during pre-alert or delays.

In the armed state, the output deactivates only once the system is disarmed.

If an alarm activates this output in the disarmed state, the output deactivates when a user enters a valid access code during bell timeout. The output also deactivates if someone arms the system after the bell timeout has expired.

If assigned to a single partition, the output activates when an enabled alarm event occurs on the assigned partition. When assigned to multiple partitions, the output activates when an alarm occurs on any partition and, if configured to latch, will deactivate when any partition is disarmed. (or a valid disarming procedure is used).

## **157 – System Tamper**

This output activates when any tamper condition is present and deactivates when all tamper conditions are cleared (if set for steady operation). If set for a pulsed operation, the output deactivates when the PGM Output timer expires. These tampers include zone tampers (DEOL), case tampers, TLM trouble, RF jam, and all zone and device tampers.

**Note:** This PGM does not activate for alternate communicator fault.

## **161 – DC Trouble**

This output activates when one of the following low battery conditions is detected:

- l Alarm controller low or absent battery
- l Module low or absent battery
- l Wireless zone low battery
- l Wireless keypad low battery
- l Wireless siren low battery
- l Wireless key low battery

The output can be configured to follow the state of the low battery trouble(s) or it can activate for a period of time and automatically restore.

## **165 – Proximity Tag Used**

This output activates when the selected proximity tag is presented.

Assign this output to a user by entering a user number from 002 to 095. To enable this attribute for all proximity tags, enter 000 in PGM attribute [011]. See "[007] - [008] PGM Configuration" on page 72.

## **175 – Bell Status and Programming Access Output**

This PGM activates when the siren, Installer Programming mode or DLS/SA is active. It deactivates after bell timeout, when Installer Programming is exited or when DLS/SA programming is disconnected.

## **176 – Remote Operation**

This output is activated and deactivated remotely on command from DLS software.

**Note:** Not for use with UL/ULC listed installations.

## **184 – Open After Alarm**

This output activates when the system has been disarmed after an alarm. It deactivates when a valid user code is entered or when the PGM Output timer expires.

## **200 – Zone Follower - PGM By Zone**

This option allows the PGM to activate when the assigned zone is opened and deactivate when the zone is restored or, if programmed, when a valid access code is entered. This PGM follows the state of the assigned zone, regardless of the partition the zone or PGM is assigned to.

To program which zone the PGM will follow, see "[011] PGM Configuration Options" on page 85.

## **201-216 – Zone Follower (Zones 1-128)**

This output type is assigned to a group of zones and is normally activated, but deactivates when a zone is tripped. Zones are assigned to this output in the following groups:

| 201 – | Zones 1-8   | 209 – | Zones 65-72   |
|-------|-------------|-------|---------------|
| 202 – | Zones 9-16  | 210 – | Zones 73-80   |
| 203 – | Zones 17-24 | 211 – | Zones 81-88   |
| 204 – | Zones 25-32 | 212 – | Zones 89-96   |
| 205 – | Zones 33-40 | 213 – | Zones 97-104  |
| 206 – | Zones 41-48 | 214 – | Zones 105-112 |
| 207 – | Zones 49-56 | 215 – | Zones 113-120 |
| 208 – | Zones 57-64 | 216 – | Zones 121-128 |

If multiple zones are enabled, any active zone in that group triggers the output. The PGM will not activate again until all zones are restored.

# **5.3.8 [011] PGM Configuration Options**

This section is used to configure PGM types that offer multiple options.

## **[001]-[164] Select PGM**

The following options may be selected for each PGM:

## **Zone Follow PGM By Zone**

This option is used to specify the zone that PGM type 200 follows. Enter 001-128 to select zone 1-128.

## **Proximity Tag Used**

This option is used to define which proximity tag will activate PGM outputs programmed as [165] Prox Used. Enter 000 to enable this PGM attribute for all user proximity tags, or enter user number 002-095 to have this attribute activated by a specific user proximity tag.

## **Command Output 1-4**

This option is used to assign a schedule, programmed in section [601]-[604], for the command output PGMs to follow.

# **5.3.9 [012] System Lockout**

## **Keypad Lockout – Number of Invalid Local Attempts**

This option controls the number of invalid access code entries allowed before the keypad is locked.

When keypad lockout occurs, the system is inaccessible by keypad for the programmed duration. If the number of invalid attempts is not reached within one hour, or if a valid access code is entered, the counter is reset to 0. Valid entries are 000 to 255 minutes. Entering 000 disables the feature. Presenting an invalid tag counts toward keypad lockout.

**Note:** For EN 50131 certified installations, maximum number of attempts is 10.

## **Keypad Lockout Duration**

This programming option determines the length of time the keypad is locked out for. If the system cold starts while in keypad lockout, the lockout is removed. Valid entries are 000 to 255 minutes. Entering 000 disables keypad lockout.

**Note:** For EN 50131 certified installations, minimum of duration is 2 minutes.

## **Remote Lockout DLS**

EN

EN

This programming option determines the number of invalid access code entries allowed via SMS or DLS before remote access is locked out for the programmed duration (see below). If the number of invalid attempts is not reached within one hour, or if a valid access code is entered through SMS or DLS, the counter is reset to 0. The valid entries are 003 to 255 attempts. Default is 6 attempts. The number of invalid attempts is fixed at 5 when using System Administrator Software and the lockout duration is 1 hour.

**Note:** DLS tries to connect using the programmed DLS Access code first and, if unsuccessful, using the default DLS access code. Two failed attempts are counted if both codes are incorrect.

## **Remote Lockout Duration**

This programming option determines how long the remote lockout lasts. If the system cold starts while in remote lockout, the lockout restarts for the programmed duration. Valid entries are 001 to 255 minutes. Entering 000 disables remote lockout.

# **5.3.10 System Options**

## **[013] System Option 1**

#### **1 – NC Loop/EOL**

ON: All zones are wired as normally closed circuits with returns connected to a COM terminal. The end-of-line resistor is not required. An alarm is generated when the circuit is opened.

OFF: All zones must be wired with an end-of-line resistor configuration, determined by option 2 below.

**Note:** The valid EOL value is 5600 Ohms (5.6KΩ).

#### **2 – DEOL/SEOL**

ON: All zones use Double-End-of-Line resistors, except Standard Fire, Delayed Fire, Auto-Verified Fire, Co and Supervisory zone types. DEOL resistors enable detection of zone faults and tampers. The tamper resistor (5.6KΩ) is placed in parallel across the alarm activating device, and the single EOL resistor (5.6KΩ) is placed between the alarm and tamper contacts.

This allows detection of zone faults (shorted zone), tampers (open zone), alarms (11.2KΩ), and restored zones (5.6KΩ).

If the zone is disarmed and placed in the tamper or fault state, trouble beeps sound on all system keypads until a key is pressed on each partition. A zone tamper is sent to the monitoring station if programmed. If the zone is armed and a tamper is activated, the tamper alarm and zone alarm are logged and transmitted.

OFF: All zones must have a 5.6KΩ resistor. If the zone is shorted or open, it is in the tripped state. If the zone is open and programmed as a fire zone, it is in the trouble state. The EOL and DEOL zone attributes override this system option.

**Note:** Zone Faults (Supervisories) on wireless zones do not cause an audible alarm while armed.

#### **3 – Show All Troubles When Armed**

ON: The Trouble LED illuminates when troubles are present on the system in both the armed and disarmed state.

OFF: The Trouble LED illuminates for all troubles while disarmed, but only for Fire Troubles while armed.

#### **4 – Tamper/Faults Do Not Show As Open**

ON: The zone LED does not illuminate if the zone is in the tamper or fault states. Only the Trouble LED illuminates.

OFF: The respective zone LED illuminates if the zone is in the tamper or fault states. The Trouble LED also illuminates.

#### **5 – Auto-Arm Schedule in [*][6]**

ON: The auto-arm schedules ([151] - [158]) are accessible to installers via [*][6] as well as Installer Programming.

OFF: The auto-arm schedules ([151] - [158]) are only accessible to installers via Installer Programming.

**Note:** This toggle controls access for all eight partitions.

### **6 – Audible Exit Fault**

OFF: The entry delay warning is sounded only through the keypad.

#### **7 – Event Buffer Follows Swinger**

ON: Once an event reaches its swinger shutdown limit programmed in "[377] Communication Variables" on page 107, it will no longer log events to the event buffer until the swinger shutdown is reset. This avoids filling the event buffer with false events.

OFF: The event buffer continues to log events to the buffer even after the event has gone into swinger shutdown.

#### **8 – Temporal Three Fire Signaling**

ON: All fire bells sound in the temporal three pattern. Cadence is as follows: (500ms ON, 500ms OFF, 500ms ON, 500ms OFF, 500ms ON, 1.5 sec. OFF).

OFF: All fire bells will sound with the standard 1 second on/1 second off fire bell cadence.

**Note:** Must be on for UL/ULC installations.

## **[014] System Option 2**

### **4 – Bell Squawk On Entry**

ON: The siren pulses with the same timing as the keypad buzzer during entry delay, changing to 3 squawks per second for the final 10 seconds.

OFF: The siren does not activate during entry delay.

#### **5 – Bell Squawk On Trouble**

ON: When a trouble condition exists on the system, the siren squawks 2 times every 10 seconds (as per the keypad buzzer). The siren is silenced when the keypad beeps are silenced (any key pressed on keypad).

OFF: The siren does not activate with a trouble condition.

#### **6 – Not Used**

#### **7 – Exit Delay Termination**

ON: The exit delay is reduced to 5 seconds once a Delay 1 zone is restored. Force-Arm Delay 1 type zones also end the exit delay.

OFF: The exit delay timer continues to count even after the delay zone is restored.

All audible options associated with the exit delay function are silenced until the time programmed for the exit delay has elapsed.

#### **8 – Fire Bell Continues**

ON: For all Fire type alarms, the siren sounds until an access code is entered to silence the alarm or disarm the system regardless of the time programmed for bell timeout.

OFF: For all Fire type alarms, the siren sounds for the length of Bell Timeout or until an access code is entered.

**Note:** Must be disabled for ULC installations.

## **[015] System Option 3**

### **1 – [F] Key Enabled**

ULC

ON: Pressing and holding the [F] key for 2 seconds triggers a Fire alarm.

OFF: The [F] key does not sound or report an alarm when pressed.

**Note:** Use only for residential fire installations.

### **2 – [P] Key Enabled**

ON: When a valid [P] key alarm is generated, the keypad buzzer emits a series of 3 beeps to acknowledge the alarm and the siren sounds for the length of bell timeout.

OFF: When a valid [P] key alarm is generated, the keypad buzzer and the siren are silent, but the alarm is still transmitted (if programmed).

**Note:** Fire, Medical, and Panic key transmissions follow the partition 1 alarm/restore call direction options (Fire, Medical, and Panic key). The Fire, Medical, Panic keys operate even if keypad blanking and keypad lockout are active.

#### **3 – Quick Exit**

ON: When the system is armed, users may enter the [*][0] command to temporarily bypass a single Delay 1 or Delay 2 zone to exit the premises. Only one delay zone may be activated. Activity on another delay zone initiates the appropriate alarm sequence. If the delay zone is still open two minutes after the [*][0] command is entered, entry delay is initiated. If armed in the Stay mode, the automatic bypass on Stay/Away zones remains.

OFF: When the system is armed, users can not perform a quick exit using [*][0].

#### **4 – Quick Arming /Function Key**

ON: [*][0] arming and Stay/Away function keys may be used to arm the system without the entry of a valid access code.

OFF: [*][0] arming is not permitted. All arming functions require the entry of an access code to activate (including Stay/Away keys).

### **5 – Not Used**

#### **7 – Telephone Line Monitor Enable**

ON: The TLM function is active and the system indicates a trouble condition when using the [*][2] View Trouble Conditions command.

OFF: The TLM function is deactivated and telephone line troubles are not indicated by the system.

**Note:** Must be ON for UL/ULC listed installations.

#### **8 – Telephone Line Monitor Audible When Armed**

ON: When the system is disarmed, a telephone line monitor trouble generates a trouble indication as described above. If the system is armed, a telephone line monitor trouble generates an audible alarm on the siren for the duration programmed for bell timeout or until an access code is entered to disarm.

OFF: Telephone line troubles generate a trouble indication, the Trouble LED illuminates, and the keypad buzzer beeps until a key is pressed.

## **[016] System Option 4**

#### **1 – AC Trouble Display**

ON: If AC power fails, the condition is reported to the monitoring station and is indicated as a trouble condition on the system keypads.

OFF: If AC power fails, the condition is reported, but the Trouble light on the system keypads is off. The trouble is displayed in [*][2].

**Note:** Must be ON for UL/ULC listed installations.

#### **2 – AC Trouble Light Flashes**

ON: When AC power is lost, the Trouble light flashes in the base "Ready" and "Armed" mode within 30 seconds of power loss. When AC restores, the Trouble light stops flashing within 30 seconds. If enabled, this option overrides the AC display option.

OFF: When AC power is lost, the Trouble light illuminates but does not flash.

#### **3 – Keypad Blanking**

ON: If no keys are pressed for 30 seconds, all keypad lights except backlighting (if enabled) are shut off until the next keypress, entry delay, audible alarm or keypad buzzer condition.

Keypad function keys still operate when the keypad is blank, unless the function key is programmed to require an access code. Keypad Blanking While Armed overrides this feature. When a partition is armed and in alarm, entering a code to remove blanking silences the alarm and disarms the system.

OFF: The keypad lights remain ON at all times.

#### **4 – Keypad Blanking Requires Code**

ON: A valid access code must be entered before a blanked keypad can be used. Information becomes inaccessible to level 1 users.

OFF: When a zone with the door chime attribute ON is opened, the system keypads do not sound door chime beeps.

#### **2 – Chime on Closing**

ON: When a zone with the door chime attribute ON is closed, the system keypads and sirens (if enabled) sound door chime beeps.

OFF: When a zone with the door chime attribute ON is closed, the system keypads and sirens (if enabled) do not sound door chime beeps.

#### **3 – RF Jam Trouble Beeps**

ON: Trouble beeps sound when an RF Jam Trouble is detected

OFF: Trouble beeps do not sound when an RF Jam Trouble is detected

#### **4 – Multi Hit**

ON: Alarms from the same zone within the Burglary Verification Timer duration cause the police code or burglary verified to be logged and transmitted. The number of zone trips required to create a confirmed alarm depends on the value of the programmable burglary verification counter.

OFF: Alarms from the same zone within the Burglary Verification Timer duration do not cause the police code or burglary verified to be logged and transmitted.

**Note:** This feature only applies to zones defined as Interior, Interior Delay, Interior Stay/Away, Instant Stay/Away, Delay Stay/Away, or Night Zones (PIR Zones).

#### **5 – Late to Close**

ON: Provides an audible warning if the alarm system has not been armed by a programmed time of day but does not arm the alarm system. The alarm system communicates and logs a Late to Close event at the end of the Auto-arm/Postpone pre-alert for each partition.

OFF: The alarm system will neither communicate nor log a Late to Close event at the time programmed for Auto-arm for each partition.

**Note:** If the Auto-arm toggle option is disabled, the Auto-arm Pre-alert still occurs when a time is programmed for that day (if enabled) and the event is logged and communicated. This option does not directly affect the functionality of Auto-arm. If Late to Close is enabled and Auto-arming is not, LCD keypads display "System Arming in Progress" during the Late to Close Prealert.

#### **6 – Daylight Savings Time**

ON: The alarm system adjusts between Daylight and Standard times according to the times programmed in System Timers ([005] options 001-002).

**Note:** Auto-arm and Test Transmissions should not be attempted between 0200 and 0300 hours, as they will be missed during a daylight savings clock adjust. Events programmed to occur between 0100 and 0200 will occur twice during a daylight savings clock adjust. Daylight Savings Time programming should not conflict with the Auto-arm and Test Transmissions programming.

OFF: The alarm system makes no automatic time adjustments for Daylight Saving time.

#### **7 – Not Used**

#### **8 – Bell Squawk on Away Arm/ Disarm Only**

ON: Bell Squawks are only heard when away arming, as well as when disarming from Away mode. This feature prevents the siren from activating when arming in stay and night modes.

OFF: Bell Squawks are heard during all types of arming and disarming.

**Note:** This option follows the "Bell Squawk Attribute" features if they are enabled.

## **[018] System Option 6**

#### **1 – Test Transmission Exception**

ON: The alarm system does not send a test transmission if a transmission was sent to the receiver within the programmed interval as set in section [377]>[003] – Periodic Test Transmission Cycle.

OFF: Test transmissions are always sent at the programmed interval.

#### **2 – Real-Time Bypass Reporting**

ON: When a non-24-hour zone is bypassed in [*][1], the system immediately logs and communicates the bypass status of the zone.

Global Zones: 24-hour and non-24 hour zone bypasses are logged and communicated in real time. Non-24 hour zone unbypass events are generated when the last assigned partition is disarmed.

OFF: When a non 24-hour zone is bypassed in [*][1], the system logs and communicates the bypass status of the zone only after the partition is armed. This option is applied regardless of how zones are bypassed in [*][1], recall bypass group, clear all bypasses, bypass open zones, bypass recall as well as other methods such as bypassing via ITv2 or DLS.

Global Zones: 24-hour zone bypasses are logged and communicated in real time. Non 24-hour zone bypass events are logged and communicated when armed. Non 24-hour zone unbypass events are logged and communicated when the last partition is disarmed.

### **3 – Not Used**

#### **4 – Not Used**

#### **5 – Keypad Buzzer Follows Bell**

ON: The keypad buzzer activates with all bell activity for the selected partition.

OFF: The keypad buzzer only activates with alarms programmed to do so.

OFF: Delay zone openings and closings do not restart the exit delay.

#### **8 – AC Fail Trouble Beeps**

ON: System keypads beep when an AC trouble event occurs.

OFF: System keypads are silent during AC troubles.

## **[019] System Option 7**

#### **1 – Audible Wireless Device Fault**

ON: If a wireless zone fault occurs while armed, the siren sounds for the duration of Bell Time Out. This option only affects zone definitions that are considered armed. The following zone types do not generate an alarm when faulted while stay armed: interior stay away zone, delay stay away zone, instant stay away zone, night zone. The following zone types do not generate an audible alarm in any armed state (stay, away, or night): 24-hour supervisory, 24-hour non-alarm, 24-hour CO, delayed 24-hour Fire, standard 24-hour fire, Auto-verified fire.

When the partition is armed, wireless supervisory troubles from sirens, keypads and repeaters generate audible alarm conditions.

If Tamper/Fault Detection is enabled, these events can start the burglary verified timer and affect the burglary verified counter.

OFF: Wireless device faults do not sound the siren.

#### **2 – Latching Troubles**

ON: Troubles remain on the system until viewed via [*][2], even if they are restored. The trouble condition is cleared when the [#] key is pressed from the [*][2] menu after the trouble has restored. The Trouble LED turns off unless other troubles are present. The trouble is not cleared if the [*][2] menu times out before the [#] key is pressed.

OFF: Troubles are cleared once restored.

### **3 – Not Used**

#### **4 – R Button**

ON: When the panel goes off hook to communicate, it performs a dial tone check. If no dialtone is detected, the panel will wait 20 seconds and perform another 5 second dial tone search. If dial tone is still not present, the panel force dials if programmed to do so. This entire sequence counts as one dialing attempt.

OFF: If no dial tone is present, the panel does not attempt to switch to a second phone line.

#### **5 – Audible Bus Fault**

ON: All module supervisory trouble conditions activate the siren.

OFF: Only zone expander supervisory trouble conditions while armed activate the siren.

#### **6 – Duress Codes**

ON: The duress code attribute can be enabled/disabled from the [*][5] menu. For UK BS8243 installations the default is off.

OFF: The duress code attribute is not programmable from the [*][5] menu.

#### **7 – Temperature in Celsius**

ON: Temperature is displayed in Celsius on LCD keypads.

OFF: Temperature is displayed in Fahrenheit on LCD keypads.

#### **8 – Reset After Zone Activation**

ON: Only a police code\sequential detection alarm requires a remote reset once the partition has been disarmed.

OFF: Any burglary alarm requires a remote reset once the partition has been disarmed.

## **[020] System Option 8**

#### **1 – Access Code Entry During Entry Delay**

ON: During entry delay the alarm system can only be disarmed using a keyswitch or proximity tag. When the siren is active an access code can still be used to disarm the system.

OFF: An access code can be used to disarm the system during entry delay.

#### **2 – EU Entry Procedure**

ON: If an alarm occurs on a zone when entry delay is not active, the siren activates and the alarm is communicated immediately, depending on the zone type tripped.

When entry delay is active, all burglary type alarms activate the siren, but communication of the alarm is delayed by 30 seconds. When entry delay expires, the alarm is not communicated unless the siren has been active for at least 30 seconds.

Police code is not generated as a result of alarms triggered during entry delay, although the Burglary Verification Timer starts after entry delay and the 30-second communication delay expire.

This feature is only active when the partition is armed.

OFF: Burglary alarms that occur during entry delay activate the siren and are communicated immediately. Two exceptions are if the bell delay timer is programmed and if transmission delay is enabled for the zone in alarm. In both cases, the alarm follows the timer.

#### **3 – [*][8] Access While Armed**

ON: This option ensures [*][8] installer programming is accessible from a keypad on a disarmed partition while other partitions on the system are still armed.

**Note:** For UL listed installations, this option must be disabled.

OFF: [*][8] installer programming is not available when any partition on the system is armed. All partitions must be disarmed and the siren must be off before [*][8] is accessible.

#### **4 – Remote Reset**

UL

NA

ON: If an alarm occurs on a burglary zone, the system is locked out after disarming. It remains locked until a 4-digit reset code, provided by the installer/central station, is keyed in. If a duress code is used to disarm the partition, the system is not locked out.

In the disarmed state, only Audible 24 Hour Burglary zones, Audible 24 Hour Latching Tamper zones, and Audible 24 Hour zone on PGM 2 cause lockout.

To obtain the reset code, the user must provide a corresponding system lock code, displayed on the keypad when one of the following conditions occurs:

- l the system has been disarmed (Duress Code excluded)
- l the bell has timed out (24Hr zones)
- l an access code has been entered (24Hr zones)

On an LCD keypad, the message "REMOTE RESET RQD" is displayed on the top line and "CODE" along with the actual code is displayed across the bottom line.

On an LED keypad, the reset number is scrolled across the screen.

While the system is locked out, the only options available are [*][3], [*][6], [*][7], and [*][8]. Accessing [*][8] Installer Programming unlocks the alarm system. The system continues to function (alarms, tampers, etc) while the system is locked out. Lock out follows both transmission and bell delays.

OFF: The system is not locked out after an alarm occurs.

**Note:** Not for use with UL/ULC listed installations.

#### **5 – Engineer's Reset (EU)**

ON: If the alarm system has gone into alarm during the previous armed period, or if a 24-hour alarm has occurred (armed or disarmed), the system cannot be armed (Ready light OFF) until Installer Programming is entered or Engineer's Reset is performed via DLS. "Reset Required" is displayed on the keypad. This feature applies to tampers and faults in both armed and disarmed states and does not apply to module tampers, system supervisories, zone expander alarms or PGM 2 input alarms.

**Note:** If Engineer's Reset is triggered during exit delay, the system still arms. Troubles cannot be overridden while Engineer's Reset is enabled.

OFF: The system does not require Engineer's Reset or to be placed into Installer Programming in order to arm the alarm system after an alarm.

#### **6 – Keyswitch Disarming During Entry Delay**

ON: Keyswitches, proximity tags and wireless keys disarm the alarm system only if an entry delay is active.

OFF: Keyswitches, proximity tags and wireless keys disarm the alarm system regardless of entry delay.

#### **7 – Installer Access and DLS**

ON: The user must enter [*][6][access code][05] before the installer can access Installer Programming by DLS or via the keypad ([*][8]).

Installer Programming remains accessible for 6 hours, during which time the installer can enter/exit or connect with DLS an unlimited number of times.

OFF: The installer can access Installer Programming without the user entering [*][6].

#### **8 – Troubles Inhibit Arming**

ON: The following troubles prevent arming until restored:

- l Tampers on the alarm system, modules and zones
- l Corbus troubles
- l AC troubles on the alarm system and modules
- l Battery troubles on the alarm system, modules and zones
- l Transmission troubles (FTC, TLM, GPRS, Ethernet)
- l Bell troubles

The alarm system can still be armed if troubles are overridden. To perform a trouble override, while in the Trouble Menu ([*] [2]), scroll right or left and press [*] when Trouble Acknowledgment is displayed on the keypad. Alternatively, press the [9] key to acknowledge and override the existing troubles.

To override open zones, faulted zones or tampered zones use the Zone Bypass feature.

OFF: The system can be armed even when troubles are present.

**Note:** When Engineer's Reset is on, trouble conditions cannot be overridden. Zone Expander supervisory troubles cannot be acknowledged and overridden. These conditions must be restored before the panel can be armed.

**Note:** When [024][3] is enabled, AC/DC Inhibit Arming, the AC or DC trouble must be restored before the system can be armed.

## **[021] System Option 9**

#### **1 – Trouble Display**

ON: If the panel is both armed and keypad blanking is active, when a trouble is present the keypad trouble LED will remain off . When the system is disarmed, or if blanking is removed, the trouble LED will be active if a trouble is present.

Time is in 24-hour format (HH:MM) and valid entries are from 00:00 to 23:59. **Note:** If entry delay is active at auto-disarm time, the system does not disarm. A valid disarming procedure is required by the user who initiated the entry delay.

### **[003] – Partition Auto-Disarming Holiday Schedules**

Use this section to select a holiday schedule group.

See "[711]-[714] Holiday Schedules" on page 115 for more information.

#### **[004] – Partition Auto-Arming Pre-Alert Timer**

Use this section to program the duration of the auto-arm pre-alert. The system arms when the pre-alert timer expires. Valid entries are from 001 - 255 minutes.

If a valid access code is keyed in, this timer is postponed for the length of time programmed in Partition Auto-Arm Postpone timer (see below). The pre-alert timer can be postponed multiple times. Keyswitches and proximity tags can be used to cancel auto-arming.

#### **[005] – Partition Auto-Arm Postpone Timer**

Use this section to program the length of time the auto-arm pre-alert timer is postponed for. Valid entries are between 001 and 255 minutes. 000 cancels the postpone timer.

When the postpone timer expires, the Auto-arm pre-alert timer restarts (unless the partition is armed). If left uninterrupted the partition arms at the end of the pre-alert.

If a code is entered during the pre-alert, auto-arm cancel/postpone is logged and communicated and the postpone timer starts. When the postpone timer expires, pre-alert is sounded again and the cycle repeats. The Auto-arm may be postponed multiple times.

#### **[006] – Partition No Activity Arming Timer**

Use this section to program the duration of the No Activity timer. If this timer expires and no zones have been activated, the partition arms in Away mode (exit delay will not sound). When the timer expires, keypad buzzers activate for the time programmed in No Activity Arming Pre-Alert (see below).

|----------|-------|------------|
| HS2128   | 128   | 8          |
| HS2064   | 64    | 8          |
| HS2032   | 32    | 4          |
| HS2016   | 16    | 2          |
| HS2016-4 | 32    | 8          |

## **[201]-[208] Partition Zone Assignment**

Zones can be assigned to any partition. Global zones are zones assigned to more than one partition. A global zone is only armed when all assigned partitions are armed. The zone is disarmed when any of the assigned partitions is disarmed. By default, zones 1 through 8 are assigned to partition 1.

To assign zones to partitions, first select a partition [201]-[208], then select a zone group [001]-[016] and then a zone (1-8):

| Zone Group | Zones | Zone Group | Zones   |
|------------|-------|------------|---------|
| 001        | 1-8   | 009        | 65-72   |
| 002        | 9-16  | 010        | 73-80   |
| 003        | 17-24 | 011        | 81-88   |
| 004        | 25-32 | 012        | 89-96   |
| 005        | 33-40 | 013        | 97-104  |
| 006        | 41-48 | 014        | 105-112 |
| 007        | 49-56 | 015        | 113-120 |
| 008        | 57-64 | 016        | 121-128 |

All zones assigned to a partition are supervised and operate according to the zone type programmed. If a zone is not assigned to a partition, it is not supervised and all activity on the zone is ignored by the system.

## **[300] Panel/Receiver Communication Paths**

This section is used to select the path of communications between the alarm system and the central station.

Paths can be established through either the alarm system's on-board Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) connection or through the alternate communicator (cellular or Ethernet) if equipped.

Paths to four receivers can be programmed using sections 001 - 004. The communications path for each receiver is defined by selecting one of the following six options:

#### **[01] Phone Line**

Events are communicated through the alarm system phone line programmed in section [301]. If Phone Line is selected for receiver 1, the phone number programmed in section [301] option [001] is used. If Phone Line is selected for receiver 2, the phone number programmed in section [301] option [002] is used, etc.

#### **[02] Alternate Communicator Auto Routing**

Selecting this option enables the alternate communicator to determine which communications path to use (Ethernet primary/secondary, and/or cellular primary/secondary). See the alternate communicator manual for details.

#### **[03] Alternate Communicator Receiver 1**

Events are communicated through IP receiver 1.

## **[04] Alternate Communicator Receiver 2**

Events are communicated through IP receiver 2.

#### **[05] Alternate Communicator Receiver 3**

Events are communicated through cellular receiver 1.

#### **[06] Alternate Communicator Receiver 4**

Events are communicated through cellular receiver 2.

To use PSTN as the communications path, program section [300] options 001 through 004 as [01] PSTN 1.

To use the alternate communicator to establish a communications path, program two of the receivers (section [300] options 001, 002, 003 or 004) as [03] and [04] for Ethernet, and two of the receivers as [05] and [06] for cellular.

## **[301] Phone Number Programming**

Section [301] is used to program up to 4 telephone numbers used to communicate with the central station over PSTN.

[001] The phone number used to communicate with receiver 1

[002] The phone number used to communicate with receiver 2

[003] The phone number used to communicate with receiver 3

[004] The phone number used to communicate with receiver 4

All telephone numbers can be a maximum of 32 digits. Hexadecimal digits may be included to perform the following functions:

- l HEX B ([*] [2] [*]) to dial "*"
- l HEX C ([*] [3] [*]) to dial "#"
- l HEX D ([*] [4] [*]) for an additional dial tone search, as required by PBX telephone systems.
- l HEX E ([*] [5] [*]) to insert a 2-second pause in the telephone number. This causes a static delay of 2 seconds before any additional dial tone search in a phone number.
- l HEX F ([*] [6] [*]) represents the end of the Phone Number (everything after F is ignored).
- l Pressing [#] in these sections exits and saves the entire phone number.

The alarm system does not attempt to communicate using PSTN if no phone number is programmed.

## **[304] Call Waiting Cancel String**

Use this section to program a string that, when pressed, disables call waiting on a phone line. Call waiting cancel is typically *70 in most areas. Dialing this string before a phone number disables call waiting for the duration of the call.

When this section is programmed and Call Waiting Cancel Options is ON (see "[382] Communicator Option 3" on page 111), the alarm system dials this string before the phone number. This is only done on the first dialing attempt for each phone number.

This is a 6-digit field. Fill unused digits with Hex F.

# **5.3.12 Reporting**

## **[307] Zone Reporting**

Zone alarms, tampers and faults are transmitted to the central station using automatic contact ID or SIA formats. Reporting can be toggled on or off by zone using toggle options 1-6 in subsections 001-128.

## **[377] Communication Variables**

#### **[001] – Swinger Shutdown**

#### **Alarms/Restores**

This value defines the number of communication attempts made for alarm/restore events, per zone, before the zone goes into swinger shutdown. Valid entries are 000 to 014. For CP-01, entries are from 001-006.

Once the programmed number of alarm/restore events have been communicated, no further alarm/restore events for the zone are communicated until swinger shutdown is reset. The last restore event is not communicated until swinger is cleared. For example, if the swinger shutdown limit for zone alarms is set to [003], the cycle is as follows: alarm/restore, alarm/restore, alarm...8 hours or arm/disarm...restore.

The bell output is not activated for alarms on zones that have exceeded the swinger shutdown counter limit. Swinger shutdown on global zones log once to the system area.

CP-01 **Note:** Swinger shutdown resets on all partitions when any partition on the system is armed or disarmed, or every day at midnight. For CP-01, swinger shutdown is restored after 8 hours of inactivity.

Once reset, the alarm system communicates normally.

**Note:** The event buffer can follow swinger shutdown if enabled.

#### **Tampers/Restores**

This value defines the number of times the same system tamper event occurs before going into swinger shutdown. Valid entries are 000 to 014.

#### **Maintenance Troubles/Restores**

This value defines the number of times the same system Maintenance (trouble) type event occurs before going into swinger shutdown. Fire troubles follow the Maintenance Swinger Shutdown variable.

### **[002] – Communication Delays**

#### **Transmission Delay (seconds)**

This value defines the delay before an alarm is transmitted.

The delay is for zones which have the Transmission Delay attribute enabled. Valid entries are from 000 to 255 seconds (0- 45 seconds for CP-01). Each partition shares the same active timer. If the delay is already active due to an alarm on a different partition, any new activity on another partition does not restart the communications delay timer.

Burglary verified events are postponed until after the transmission delay expires. When a valid disarming procedure is used while the transmission delay is active, a communications canceled message is briefly displayed on the keypad when the delay is canceled.

**Note:** For UL/ULC listed installations, the entry delay plus communication delay cannot exceed 45 seconds.

#### **AC Failure Communication Delay (minutes or hours)**

This value determines the delay before an AC failure or AC restore is reported. The AC failure or restore is still displayed immediately. Valid entries are from 000 to 255 minutes/hours (max. 180 minutes for UL commercial installations). Selection of minutes or hours for the delay is set in section "[382] Communicator Option 3" on page 111.

**Note:** If AC Failure Communications Delay is programmed as 000, the AC Failure Trouble reporting code is sent immediately.

**Note:** For ULC commercial fire monitoring, the setting shall be 180 minutes.

#### **TLM Trouble Delay**

NA

ULC

Use this section to program the number of valid checks (3 second intervals) required before a telephone line trouble is generated. Valid entries are 000-255 for trouble annunciation and transmission delays of 3 to 765 Seconds (12.75 Minutes).

#### **Wireless Zone Low Battery Transmission Delay (in days)**

When a zone reports a low battery condition, the trouble is indicated immediately on the keypad, but the transmission to the monitoring station is delayed by the number of days programmed in this section. If the low battery condition is not corrected before the delay expires, the low battery condition is transmitted. The Low Battery Restore transmission is not delayed.

#### **Delinquency Transmission Delay**

The value in this section determines the period of time before a delinquency event is generated.

Delinquency delay is measured in days if using closing delinquency or hours if using activity delinquency as programmed in section [311] option 6. Valid entries are [001]-[255] or [000] to disable.

#### **Communications Cancel Window**

After the transmission Delay expires and a zone alarm is transmitted, the communications cancel window begins.

If an access code is entered during this window, a reporting code is communicated and logged. If the window expires without an access code entry or a code is entered after the window, the communications canceled event is not logged or communicated.

**Note:** The cancel window does not start after an [F][M][P] key alarm.

#### **[003] – Periodic Test Transmission Cycle**

This value determines the period between test transmissions. Valid entries are [000]-[255]. Whether this interval is in hours or days is determined by section [022], option 4.

NA **Note:** For UL/ULC listed installations, the test interval is 24 hours.

#### **[004] – Periodic Test Transmission Time of Day**

Enter a 4-digit time using the 24-hour clock format (HH:MM).

Valid entries are from 00 to 23 for the hours (HH) and 00 to 59 for the minutes (MM).

To disable the test transmission time of day, enter [9999] in this section.

**Note:** This time should not be set for the same time as Day Light Savings time.

#### **[011] – Maximum Dialing Attempts**

NA **Note:** For UL/ULC listed installations, this value must be set to 005.

#### **[012] – Delay Between PSTN Attempts**

This programmable timer adds a delay before the next call is attempted over PSTN. Valid entries are 000-255, with a default of 3 seconds (making a total of 8 seconds: 3-second delay + standard 5-second dial tone search).

#### **[013] – Delay Between Force Attempts**

This programming option is used to set the length of time the alarm system waits between the first dialing attempt and the force dial attempt.

Valid Entries are 001-255 seconds. Default is 020.

#### **[014] – Post Dial Wait for Handshake**

This option is used to program the length of time the communicator waits for a valid initial handshake from the receiver after dialing the programmed telephone number. Valid entries are 001 to 255 seconds.

**Note:** Maximum 45 seconds for UL installations.

#### **[015] – T-Link Wait for Ack**

UL

This option is used to program the length of time the communicator waits for an acknowledge after transmitting via IP/GS. Valid entries are 001 to 255. Default is 60 seconds.

#### **[016] –IP/Cellular Fault Check Timer**

This section is used to program the number of poll commands sent without valid poll responses before the alarm system generates a trouble condition. The checks occur at 3-second intervals.

Valid entries are 003-255 for trouble annunciation and transmission.

The trouble restore is not delayed.

## **[380] Communicator Option 1**

#### **5 – Parallel Communications**

ON: Parallel communications is enabled. The alarm system attempts to communicate through all available receivers at the same time. Once acknowledgment is provided by any of the receivers, the alarm system communicates the next event. If more than one receiver is configured for PSTN, the backup procedure described below is followed.

OFF: Parallel communications is disabled. If receiver 1 fails, the alarm system attempts to communicate with the next available receiver (2-4) in sequence.

**Note:** See "[384] Communicator Backup Options" on page 112 for communicator backup programming.

#### **6 – Alternate Dial**

ON: After each failed dialing attempt, the communicator switches to the next backup receiver in the sequence:

- l Receiver 2 backs up Receiver 1
- l Receiver 3 backs up Receiver 2

#### l Receiver 4 backs up Receiver 3

This continues until communication is successful or the sequence has been repeated 5 times (depending on the number of maximum dialing attempts). If all 5 attempts fail, an FTC trouble for the primary phone number is logged. All backup receivers automatically use the same call directions and format as the primary receiver.

OFF: After 5 failed attempts to communicate with the primary receiver, the communicator switches to the next backup receiver in the sequence and makes up to 5 more attempts. This continues until communication is successful or until all backup receivers fail, at which point an FTC trouble for the primary number is logged.

#### **7 – Reduced Dialing Attempts**

ON: If a TLM trouble is present, The alarm system immediately attempts to call the backup receiver. This option only applies to PSTN. Backup communications must be enabled. See option 5, Parallel Communications.

A minimum of two receivers should be enabled for this feature to operate as intended. This feature should not be enabled unless the panel is programmed to use backup communication paths.

OFF: If a TLM trouble is present, the number of dialing attempts programmed shall be attempted before moving on to the backup receiver.

#### **8 – Activity Delinquency**

ON: Inactivity on a partition for a programmed duration (section [377] option 002, Delinquency Transmission Delay) transmits a Delinquency code to the central station. This option is designed to help monitor the elderly or disabled. The counter is reset if zone activity is detected or if the system is armed. The Delinquency Transmission Delay is in hours.

**Note:** Delinquency code is not transmitted while Away armed. Activity on bypassed zones does not affect this timer.

OFF: The Delinquency reporting code is sent when the programmed number of days for delinquency (section [377]) expires without the partition being Armed. Once the code is sent, the timer is not started again until the partition has been armed. Each day programmed in the counter represents one day plus the time it takes for the partition to reach midnight. To disable this feature, program 000 in section [377]>[002] option 5.

## **[381] Communicator Option 2**

#### **1 – Keypad Ringback**

**Note:** This feature controls the DLS window for PSTN connections only.

#### **2 – User Enables/Disables DLS**

ON : The [*][6][Master Code][05] command enables a 6-hour window where, on power-up, downloading calls are answered if a successful double call routine is detected.

OFF: The user cannot enable a downloading window.

#### **3 – DLS CallBack**

ON : When a downloading call is answered, both the computer and the alarm system hang up. The alarm system then calls the downloading computer back using the downloading telephone number and begins the DLS session.

**Note:** Disable this option if using more than one downloading computer.

OFF : After successful validation, the downloading computer gains immediate access to the alarm system.

#### **4 – User Call-Up**

ON : A single call attempt can be made to the downloading computer using [*][6][Master Code][06].

OFF: [*][6][Master Code][06] does not allow initiation of a downloading session.

#### **6 – Panel Call-Up and Baud Rate**

ON : When a DLS/SA session is initiated by the user, the initial header is sent at 300 baud.

OFF: When a DLS/SA session is initiated by the user, the initial header is sent at 110 baud. The alarm system will then switch to 300 baud in order to receive the response from the DLS computer.

#### **7 – Alternate Communicator DLS**

ON: When this feature is enabled, the alarm system responds to DLS requests through the alternate communicator IP or cellular paths at any time, regardless of whether the DLS window is active or not.

However, if a pre-defined number of consecutive incorrect DLS access codes is detected (See "Remote Lockout DLS" on page 85) while trying to establish a connection, alternate communicator DLS access is locked out until the next hour rollover.

OFF: When this feature is disabled, the alarm system only responds to DLS requests through the alternate communicator IP or cellular paths when the DLS window is active.

The DLS/SA window is active following a power up or if enabled using [*][6][maser code][05] (System Service/DLS).

**Note:** This option controls DLS over alternate communicator only.

## **[402] PSTN DLS Phone Number Programming**

This section is used to program the telephone number for DLS downloading over PSTN. This phone number is used for User Call Up, Periodic DLS and DLS Call back. If no phone number is programmed, the system attempts to use the alternate communicator IP path (if configured).

The maximum number length is 32 digits.

## **[403] DLS Access Code**

This 6-digit hexadecimal code allows the alarm system to confirm the identity of the downloading computer.

If the code does not match the computer, the alarm system does not allow DLS access.

Once a DLS connection is established, the operator is allowed three attempts to enter the correct access code. If these attempts are unsuccessful, the alarm system disconnects and a new attempt must be made.

If cellular or IP paths are used for the DLS connection, a pre-programmed number of unsuccessful attempts causes a 1-hour DLS lockout. Number of attempts is programmed in section [012].

## **[404] DLS/SA Panel ID**

This 10-digit hexadecimal code identifies the alarm system to the downloading computer.

## **[405] PSTN Double Call Timer**

Use this section to program the amount of time that can elapse between the first and second call when using Double Call downloading. Valid entries are 001 to 255 (seconds).

## **[406] PSTN Number of Rings to Answer On**

The value in this section determines how many rings are required in order to establish a DLS connection. Default value is 000 rings. Valid entries are [000]-[020].

**Note:** If Double-Call option and Number of Rings to Answer are enabled, either one will work depending on how the installer calls the alarm system.

## **[407] SA Access Code**

This 6-digit hexadecimal code allows the alarm system to confirm the identity of the downloading computer.

If the code does not match the computer, the alarm system does not allow uploading/downloading.

Programming the access code as FFFFFF disables SA access.

Once an SA connection is established, multiple attempts to input the correct downloading access code (programmed in [012]) is allowed.

The operator is allowed three attempts to enter the correct access code. If these attempts are unsuccessful, the alarm system disconnects and a new attempt must be made.

If cellular or IP paths are used for the SA connection, up to five unsuccessful attempts causes a 1-hour SA lockout (See "Remote Lockout DLS" on page 85).

## **[410] Automatic DLS/SA Options**

#### **[001] – Auto DLS Options**

#### **1 – Periodic DLS**

ON: Upload/download commands programmed in advance (batch files) are periodically downloaded to the DLS computer.

See below to program the times and days when this occurs.

**Note:** The computer must be waiting for a call in order for this feature to work.

OFF: The alarm system does not periodically call the downloading computer.

#### **3 – DLS on Event Buffer %75 Full**

ON: The alarm system automatically calls the downloading computer with DLS when the Event Buffer 75% full event occurs.

This option is independent of the actual transmission of the Event Buffer 75% full event (the event does not need to be transmitted for the panel to perform the automatic upload).

The panel first communicates the Event Buffer 75% full event (if enabled) using either PSTN or IP and then performs the automatic download.

OFF: The alarm system does not automatically call the downloading computer when the Event Buffer 75% full event occurs.

#### **8 – DLS on Programming Change**

ON: When the panel returns to the "Ready to Arm" screen after a programming change, 15 minutes later the alarm system automatically calls the downloading computer.

OFF: The alarm system does not automatically call the downloading computer when the system programming changes.

#### **[002] Periodic DLS Days**

This section is used to program the number of days between periodic DLS downloads. Valid entries are from 001 to 255 days.

#### **[003] Periodic DLS Time**

This section is used to program the time of day periodic DLS download takes place. Time is in 24-hour format and the default is 00:00 (midnight).

#### **[007] Delay Call Window**

This section is used to define a user call-up window. Users can only initiate a downloading session during this window. When a value is entered in this section, the setting in Periodic DLS Time (see the option above) is overridden. When 00:00 is entered in this field, the alarm system initiates a DLS call at the time programmed in Periodic DLS Time. Start and end times must be defined using 24-hour format (e.g., 13:30) and cannot span a day (e.g., start time of 23:00 and an end time of 01:00).

# **5.3.15 Virtual Inputs**

When using an alternate communicator, virtual zones can be mapped to configured system zones.

#### **[560][001]-[032]**

Assign corresponding 3 digit zone number to virtual input and then the virtual input can be controlled by an alternate communicator. Refer to the communicator manual for more information

# **5.3.16 Schedule Programming**

The sections described below are used for programming scheduled operating times for PGM command outputs 1-4.

## **[601]-[604] Programming Schedule 1-4**

These sections are used to define schedules for PGM command outputs 1-4 operation. When a PGM is configured for timed output operation, it activates at the programmed start time and will turn off after the programmed duration. For example, 5 seconds.

Each schedule contains 4 intervals, for Command Outputs 1-4. Within each interval, a start time and end time can be programmed for each day of the week. Holiday schedules 1-4 can also be selected. To enable the command output to follow a schedule, program the command output in section [009] and then enter schedule 001 - 004 in section [011].

#### **[101]-[102] Set Start Time/ End Time**

Used to program the time of day the schedule interval begins and ends. (HH:MM). Valid entries are 0000-2359 and 9999. The end time must be equal to or greater than the start time. 9999 is used when an interval needs to extend past 24 hours. To do this, program the start time of the first interval then the end time with 9999. Program the start time of the second interval as 9999 and the end time with the desired time when the output should deactivate. Select the day of the week the schedule will end.

**Note:** If two intervals in a schedule are programmed with the same start time, the schedule follows the interval with the longest end time.

#### **[103] Days Assignment**

Used to program the day of the week that the schedule interval starts and ends. Use the scroll keys to select a day then toggle the option on. Multiple days of the week can be enabled.

### **[104] Holiday Assignment**

Program PGMs to follow holiday schedule group 1-4. Select (Y) to enable. If all days of the week for an interval are disabled (N), the schedule activates on the enabled holidays.

## **[711]-[714] Holiday Schedules**

#### **IMPORTANT!**

Ensure you have the following information available before contacting Customer Support :

Alarm controller type and version, (e.g., HSM2064 1.0):

Note: Version number can be accessed by entering [*][Installer Code][900] on any LCD keypad. This information is also located on a sticker on the printed circuit board.

List of modules connected to control panel, (e.g., HSM2108, HSM2HOSTx etc.) .

# Appendix 1: Reporting Codes

The following tables contain Contact ID and Automatic SIA format reporting codes. See "[308] Event Reporting" on page 100 for event reporting codes.

#### **Contact ID**

Each of the digits indicate specific information about the signal. For example, if zone 1 is an entry/exit point, the event code contains [34]. The central station would receive the following:

*BURG - ENTRY/EXIT - 1 where the "1" indicates which zone went into alarm.

"Contact ID and SIA Zone Alarm/Restore Event Codes" on page 192 for code definitions.

#### **SIA Format - Level 2 (Hard Coded)**

The SIA communication format used in this product follows the level 2 specifications of the SIA Digital Communication Standard - October 1997. This format sends the account code along with its data transmission. The transmission appears similar to the following at the receiver:

N ri1 BA 01

N = New Event

ri1 = Partition /Area Identifier

BA = Burglary Alarm

01 = Zone 1

A system event uses the Area Identifier ri00.

**CAUTION:** Changes or modifications not expressly approved by Digital Security Controls could void your authority to use this equipment.

This equipment has been tested and found to comply with the limits for a Class B digital device, pursuant to Part 15 of the FCC Rules. These limits are designed to provide reasonable protection against harmful interference in a residential installation. This equipment generates, uses and can radiate radio frequency energy and, if not installed and used in accordance with the instructions, may cause harmful interference to radio communications. However, there is no guarantee that interference will not occur in a particular installation. If this equipment does cause harmful interference to radio or television reception, which can be deter-mined by turning the equipment off and on, the user is encouraged to try to correct the interference by one or more of the following measures:

- l Re-orient the receiving antenna.
- l Increase the separation between the equipment and receiver.
- l Connect the equipment into an outlet on a circuit different from that to which the receiver is connected.
- l Consult the dealer or an experienced radio/television technician for help.

REN: 0.1B

USOC Jack: RJ-31X

#### **Telephone Connection Requirements**

A plug and jack used to connect this equipment to the premises wiring and telephone network must comply with the applicable FCC Part 68 rules and requirements adopted by the ACTA. A compliant telephone cord and modular plug is provided with this product. It is designed to be connected to a compatible modular jack that is also compliant. See installation instructions for details.

#### **Ringer Equivalence Number (REN)**

The REN is used to determine the number of devices that may be connected to a telephone line. Excessive RENs on a telephone line may result in the devices not ringing in response to an incoming call. In most but not all areas, the sum of RENs should not exceed five (5.0). To be certain of the number of devices that may be connected to a line, as determined by the total RENs, contact the local Telephone Company. For products approved after July 23, 2001, the REN for this product is part of the product identifier that has the format.

US: AAAEQ##TXXXX. The digits represented by ## are the REN without a decimal point (e.g., 03 is a REN of 0.3). For earlier products, the REN is separately shown on the label.

#### **Incidence of Harm**

If this equipment HS2016/HS2032/HS2064/HAS2128 causes harm to the telephone network, the telephone company will notify you in advance that temporary discontinuance of service may be required. But if advance notice is not practical, the Telephone Company will notify the customer as soon as possible. Also, you will be advised of your right to file a complaint with the FCC if you believe it is necessary.

#### **Changes in Telephone Company Equipment or Facilities**

#### **Additional Information**

Connection to party line service is subject to state tariffs. Contact the state public utility commission, public service commission or corporation commission for information.

Alarm dialling equipment must be able to seize the telephone line and place a call in an emergency situation. It must be able to do this even if other equipment (telephone, answering system, computer modem, etc.) already has the telephone line in use. To do so, alarm dialling equipment must be connected to a properly installed RJ-31X jack that is electrically in series with and ahead of all other equipment attached to the same telephone line. Proper installation is depicted in the figure below. If you have any questions concerning these instructions, you should consult your telephone company or a qualified installer about installing the RJ-31X jack and alarm dialling equipment for you.

#### **Programming**

The notes in the programming sections of the PowerSeries Neo Reference Manual describing the system configurations for UL/ULC listed installations shall be implemented.

#### **Control of the Protected Premises**

In order to have a UL certificated system, the protected area is to be under the responsibility of one ownership and management (i.e., one business under one name). This may be a group of buildings attached or unattached with different addresses but under the responsibility of someone having mutual interest. The person of mutual interest is not the alarm-installing company.

**Note:** This does not apply to strip mall applications where each independent business must have their own separate alarm system.

e.g.,1: a commercial partitioned system that has an office and a warehouse area in a building where each area can be armed or disarmed independently.

e.g.,2: a residential system partitioned so that the garage area is armed separately from the house.

Each of the above examples is under the sole responsibility of a single owner. The bell and DACT power supply must be in a protected area including partitioned systems. The bell and DACT power supply must be located where it can be heard by the person or persons responsible for maintaining the security system during the daily arming cycle.

#### **Bell Location**

The alarm sounding device (bell) shall be located where it can be heard by the person operating the security system during the daily arming and disarming cycle.

#### **Protection of the Control Unit**

- l The local control unit and the local power supply must be protected in one of the following ways:
- l The control unit and audible alarm device must be in a protected area which is armed 24 hours a day.
- l Each partition must arm the area protecting the control unit and the audible alarm device power supply. This may require duplicate protection armed by each partition. Access to this protected area, without causing and alarm, will require that all partitions be disarmed.
- l In all cases described above, the protected area for the control unit must be programmed as not-bypassable.

#### **Casual Users**

The installer should caution the user(s) not to give system information (e.g., codes, bypass methods, etc.) to casual users (baby-sitters or service people). Only the One-Time Use codes shall be given to casual users.

#### **User Information**

The installer should advise the users and note in the User's Manual:

- l Service organization name and telephone number
	- l The programmed exit time
	- l The programmed entry time
- l Test system weekly
- l The installer code cannot arm or disarm the system

#### **UK Compliance Statement**

In the UK this product is suitable for use in systems installed to conform to PD 6662:2010 at Grade 2 and environmental class 2 with the following notification options: A, B, C, D, X.

The CIE and notification equipment should be located and supervised to minimize the risk of vandalism or sabotage. It is preferable for the CIE, signaling and network equipment to be located in an area where a confirmed activation will be generated.

HS2128, HS2064, HS2032, HS2016 are compliant with criteria for sequentially confirmed intruder alarm systems as per Standard BS8243:2010.

For an alarm condition to be regarded as sequentially confirmed:

a) The HS2128, HS2064, HS2032, HS20163 should be configured so that at least two separate alarm conditions are reported, each originating from an independent detector within the confirmation time; Section [042] option 003 (Sequential Detection), section [005]>[000], Burglary Verification Timer set to a value between 30 and 60.

b) The two detectors should either be of:

1) different technologies which are permitted to have overlapping areas of coverage; or

2) the same single technology and not have overlapping areas of coverage.

To be regarded as independent, each detector should be configured to report alarm conditions separately to the HS2128, HS2064, HS2032, HS2016.

The HS2128, HS2064, HS2032, HS2016 are capable of supporting the completion of the full setting procedure by one of the following methods:

a) push button switch mounted outside the supervised premises. Instructions to be provided for the zone type to be programmed for the key arming; or

b) protective switch (i.e., door contact) fitted to the final exit door of the alarmed premises or area. Use zone type 016 (Final Door Set) for the final exit door.

In this case the setting procedure is a two-stage process of initiating the setting procedure within the supervised premises (e.g., using wireless key PG8929,G8939, G8938, G8949 or user code) followed by completion of setting by one of the two methods described above.

This prohibits the use of a timed exit procedure.

If a protective switch (i.e. door contact) is used as the method of completion of setting, then the keypad should be sited near to the final exit door so that the IAS can be unset promptly. Where appropriate, additional internal audible indications (PG8911 indoor sirens) should be provided so that persons within a building are informed that the HS2128, HS2064, HS2032, HS2016 are due to be set. Additional keypads should be provided, where appropriate, so that if the alarm panel is set there are means available locally within the supervised premises to unset the system.

HS2128, HS2064, HS2032, HS2016 are capable of supporting the following unsetting methods in accordance with BS8243:

6.4.2 Prevention of entry to the supervised premises before the HS2128, HS2064, HS2032, HS2016 are unset. Unsetting using PG8929,G8939, G8938, G8949 wireless key before entering the supervised premises causes or permits the initial entry door to be unlocked. Program PGM1 or PGM2 in Section [009] to activate when system is disarmed and release the mag-lock on the entry door.

Compliance labeling should be removed or adjusted if non-compliant configurations are selected.

#### **Locating Detectors and Escape Plan**

The following information is for general guidance only and it is recommended that local fire codes and regulations be consulted when locating and installing smoke and CO alarms.

### **Smoke Detectors**

Research has shown that all hostile fires in homes generate smoke to a greater or lesser extent. Experiments with typical fires in homes indicate that detectable quantities of smoke precede detectable levels of heat in most cases. For these reasons, smoke alarms should be installed outside of each sleeping area and on each storey of the home.

The following information is for general guidance only and it is recommended that local fire codes and regulations be consulted when locating and installing smoke alarms.

It is recommended that additional smoke alarms beyond those required for minimum protection be installed. Additional areas that should be protected include: the basement; bedrooms, especially where smokers sleep; dining rooms; furnace and utility rooms; and any hallways not protected by the required units. On smooth ceilings, detectors may be spaced 9.1m (30 feet) apart as a guide. Other spacing may be required depending on ceiling height, air movement, the presence of joists, uninsulated ceilings, etc. Consult National Fire Alarm Code NFPA 72, CAN/ULC-S553-02 or other appropriate national standards for installation recommendations.

- l Do not locate smoke detectors at the top of peaked or gabled ceilings; the dead air space in these locations may prevent the unit from detecting smoke.
- l Avoid areas with turbulent air flow, such as near doors, fans or windows. Rapid air movement around the detector may prevent smoke from entering the unit.
- l Do not locate detectors in areas of high humidity.
- l Do not locate detectors in areas where the temperature rises above 38ºC (100ºF) or falls below 5ºC (41ºF).
- l Smoke detectors should always be installed in USA in accordance with Chapter 11 of NFPA 72, the National Fire Alarm Code: 11.5.1.1.

Where required by applicable laws, codes, or standards for a specific type of occupancy, approved single- and multiple-station smoke alarms shall be installed as follows:

1. In all sleeping rooms and guest rooms.

2. Outside of each separate dwelling unit sleeping area, within 6.4 m (21 ft) of any door to a sleeping room, the distance measured along a path of travel.

3. On every level of a dwelling unit, including basements.

4. On every level of a residential board and care occupancy (small facility), including basements and excluding crawl spaces and unfinished attics.

5. In the living area(s) of a guest suite.

6. In the living area(s) of a residential board and care occupancy (small facility).

## **Fire Escape Planning**

There is often very little time between the detection of a fire and the time it becomes deadly. It is thus very important that a family escape plan be developed and rehearsed.

1. Every family member should participate in developing the escape plan.

Study the possible escape routes from each location within the house. Since many fires occur at night, special attention should be given to the escape routes from sleeping quarters.

Escape from a bedroom must be possible without opening the interior door.

Consider the following when making your escape plans:

- l Make sure that all border doors and windows are easily opened. Ensure that they are not painted shut, and that their locking mechanisms operate smoothly.
- l If opening or using the exit is too difficult for children, the elderly or handicapped, plans for rescue should be developed. This includes making sure that those who are to perform the rescue can promptly hear the fire warning signal.
- l If the exit is above the ground level, an approved fire ladder or rope should be provided as well as training in its use.
- l Exits on the ground level should be kept clear. Be sure to remove snow from exterior patio doors in winter; outdoor furniture or equipment should not block exits.
- l Each person should know the predetermined assembly point where everyone can be accounted for (e.g., across the street or at a neighbor's house). Once everyone is out of the building, call the fire department.
- l A good plan emphasizes quick escape. Do not investigate or attempt to fight the fire, and do not gather belongings as this can waste valuable time. Once outside, do not re-enter the house. Wait for the fire department.
- l Write the fire escape plan down and rehearse it frequently so that should an emergency arise, everyone will know what to do. Revise the plan as conditions change, such as the number of people in the home, or if there are changes to the building's construction.
- l Make sure your fire warning system is operational by conducting weekly tests. If you are unsure about system operation, contact your installer.

We recommend that you contact your local fire department and request further information on fire safety and escape planning. If available, have your local fire prevention officer conduct an in-house fire safety inspection.

#### **Carbon Monoxide Detectors**

Carbon monoxide is colorless, odorless, tasteless, and very toxic, it also moves freely in the air. CO detectors can measure the concentration and sound a loud alarm before a potentially harmful level is reached. The human body is most vulnerable to the effects of CO gas during sleeping hours; therefore, CO detectors should be located in or as near as possible to sleeping areas of the home. For maximum protection, a CO alarm should be located outside primary sleeping areas or on each level of your home. Figure 5 indicates the suggested locations in the home.

Do NOT place the CO alarm in the following areas:

- l Where the temperature may drop below -10ºC or exceed 40ºC
- l Near paint thinner fumes
- l Within 5 feet (1.5m) of open flame appliances such as furnaces, stoves and fireplaces
- l In exhaust streams from gas engines, vents, flues or chimneys
- l Do not place in close proximity to an automobile exhaust pipe; this will damage the detector

PLEASE REFER TO THE CO DETECTOR INSTALLATION AND OPERATING INSTRUCTION SHEET FOR SAFETY INSTRUCTIONS AND EMERGENCY INFORMATION.

If the laws of such a jurisdiction apply to any claim by or against DSC, the limitations and disclaimers contained here shall be to the greatest extent permitted by law. Some states do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so that the above may not apply to you.

#### **Disclaimer of Warranties**

This warranty contains the entire warranty and shall be in lieu of any and all other warranties, whether expressed or implied (including all implied warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose) and of all other obligations or liabilities on the part of Digital Security Controls. Digital Security Controls neither assumes responsibility for, nor authorizes any other person purporting to act on its behalf to modify or to change this warranty, nor to assume for it any other warranty or liability concerning this product. This disclaimer of warranties and limited warranty are governed by the laws of the province of Ontario, Canada.

WARNING: Digital Security Controls recommends that the entire system be completely tested on a regular basis. However, despite frequent testing, and due to, but not limited to, criminal tampering or electrical disruption, it is possible for this product to fail to perform as expected.

#### **Out of Warranty Repairs**

Anyone returning goods to Digital Security Controls must first obtain an authorization number. Digital Security Controls will not accept any shipment whatsoever for which prior authorization has not been obtained.

Products which Digital Security Controls determines to be repairable will be repaired and returned. A set fee which Digital Security Controls has predetermined and which may be revised from time to time, will be charged for each unit repaired.

Products which Digital Security Controls determines not to be repairable will be replaced by the nearest equivalent product available at that time. The current market price of the replacement product will be charged for each replacement unit.

#### **WARNING - READ CAREFULLY**

#### **Note to Installers**

This warning contains vital information. As the only individual in contact with system users, it is your responsibility to bring each item in this warning to the attention of the users of this system.

#### **System Failures**

This system has been carefully designed to be as effective as possible. There are circumstances, however, involving fire, burglary, or other types of emergencies where it may not provide protection. Any alarm system of any type may be

compromised deliberately or may fail to operate as expected for a variety of reasons. Some but not all of these reasons may be:

#### **Inadequate Installation**

A security system must be installed properly in order to provide adequate protection. Every installation should be evaluated by a security professional to ensure that all access points and areas are covered. Locks and latches on windows and doors must be secure and operate as intended. Windows, doors, walls, ceilings and other building materials must be of sufficient strength and construction to provide the level of protection expected. A reevaluation must be done during and after any construction activity. An evaluation by the fire and/or police department is highly recommended if this service is available.

#### **Criminal Knowledge**

This system contains security features which were known to be effective at the time of manufacture. It is possible for persons with criminal intent to develop techniques which reduce the effectiveness of these features. It is important that a security system be reviewed periodically to ensure that its features remain effective and that it be updated or replaced if it is found that it does not provide the protection expected.

#### **Access by Intruders**

Intruders may enter through an unprotected access point, circumvent a sensing device, evade detection by moving through an area of insufficient coverage, disconnect a warning device, or interfere with or prevent the proper operation of the system.

### **Power Failure**

Control units, intrusion detectors, smoke detectors and many other security devices require an adequate power supply for proper operation. If a device operates from batteries, it is possible for the batteries to fail. Even if the batteries have not failed, they must be charged, in good condition and installed correctly. If a device operates only by AC power, any interruption, however brief, will render that device inoperative while it does not have power. Power interruptions of any length are often accompanied by voltage fluctuations which may damage electronic equipment such as a security system. After a power interruption has occurred, immediately conduct a complete system test to ensure that the system operates as intended.

### **Failure of Replaceable Batteries**

This system's wireless transmitters have been designed to provide several years of battery life under normal conditions. The expected battery life is a function of the device environment, usage and type. Ambient conditions such as high humidity, high or low temperatures, or large temperature fluctuations may reduce the expected battery life. While each transmitting device has a low battery monitor which identifies when the batteries need to be replaced, this monitor may fail to operate as expected. Regular testing and maintenance will keep the system in good operating condition.

#### **Compromise of Radio Frequency (Wireless) Devices**

Signals may not reach the receiver under all circumstances which could include metal objects placed on or near the radio path or deliberate jamming or other inadvertent radio signal interference.

### **System Users**

A user may not be able to operate a panic or emergency switch possibly due to permanent or temporary physical disability, inability to reach the device in time, or unfamiliarity with the correct operation. It is important that all system users be trained in the correct operation of the alarm system and that they know how to respond when the system indicates an alarm.

#### **Smoke Detectors**

Smoke detectors that are a part of this system may not properly alert occupants of a fire for a number of reasons, some of which follow. The smoke detectors may have been improperly installed or positioned. Smoke may not be able to reach the smoke detectors, such as when the fire is in a chimney, walls or roofs, or on the other side of closed doors. Smoke detectors may not detect smoke from fires on another level of the residence or building.

Every fire is different in the amount of smoke produced and the rate of burning. Smoke detectors cannot sense all types of fires equally well. Smoke detectors may not provide timely warning of fires caused by carelessness or safety hazards such as smoking in bed, violent explosions, escaping gas, improper storage of flammable materials, overloaded electrical circuits, children playing with matches or arson.

Even if the smoke detector operates as intended, there may be circumstances when there is insufficient warning to allow all occupants to escape in time to avoid injury or death.

#### **Motion Detectors**

Motion detectors can only detect motion within the designated areas as shown in their respective installation instructions. They cannot discriminate between intruders and intended occupants. Motion detectors do not provide volumetric area protection. They have multiple beams of detection and motion can only be detected in unobstructed areas covered by these beams. They cannot detect motion which occurs behind walls, ceilings, floor, closed doors, glass partitions, glass doors or windows. Any type of tampering whether intentional or unintentional such as masking, painting, or spraying of any material on the lenses, mirrors, windows or any other part of the detection system will impair its proper operation.

Passive infrared motion detectors operate by sensing changes in temperature. However their effectiveness can be reduced when the ambient temperature rises near or above body temperature or if there are intentional or unintentional sources of heat in or near the detection area. Some of these heat sources could be heaters, radiators, stoves, barbeques, fireplaces, sunlight, steam vents, lighting and so on.

### **Warning Devices**

Warning devices such as sirens, bells, horns, or strobes may not warn people or waken someone sleeping if there is an intervening wall or door. If warning devices are located on a different level of the residence or premise, then it is less likely that the occupants will be alerted or awakened. Audible warning devices may be interfered with by other noise sources such as stereos, radios, televisions, air conditioners or other appliances, or passing traffic. Audible warning devices, however loud, may not be heard by a hearing-impaired person.

#### **Telephone Lines**

If telephone lines are used to transmit alarms, they may be out of service or busy for certain periods of time. Also an intruder may cut the telephone line or defeat its operation by more sophisticated means which may be difficult to detect.

#### **Insufficient Time**

There may be circumstances when the system will operate as intended, yet the occupants will not be protected from the emergency due to their inability to respond to the warnings in a timely manner. If the system is monitored, the response may not occur in time to protect the occupants or their belongings.

### **Component Failure**

Although every effort has been made to make this system as reliable as possible, the system may fail to function as intended due to the failure of a component.

### **Inadequate Testing**

Most problems that would prevent an alarm system from operating as intended can be found by regular testing and maintenance. The complete system should be tested weekly and immediately after a break-in, an attempted break-in, a fire, a storm, an earthquake, an accident, or any kind of construction activity inside or outside the premises. The testing should include all sensing devices, keypads, consoles, alarm indicating devices and any other operational devices that are part of the system.

#### **Security and Insurance**

Regardless of its capabilities, an alarm system is not a substitute for property or life insurance. An alarm system also is not a substitute for property owners, renters, or other occupants to act prudently to prevent or minimize the harmful effects of an emergency situation.
