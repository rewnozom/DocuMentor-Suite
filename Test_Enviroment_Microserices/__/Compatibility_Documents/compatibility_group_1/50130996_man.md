## LZR® -FLATSCAN SW

SAFETY SENSOR FOR AUTOMATIC SWING DOORS

User's Guide for product version 0201 and higher See product label for serial number

### **INSTALLATION TIPS**

![](_page_1_Picture_1.jpeg)

Remove the laser window protection before the teach-in and the commissioning of the sensor.

![](_page_1_Picture_3.jpeg)

Avoid vibrations. Do not cover

![](_page_1_Picture_5.jpeg)

the laser window.

![](_page_1_Picture_7.jpeg)

Avoid moving objects and light sources in the detection field.

![](_page_1_Picture_9.jpeg)

Avoid the presence of smoke and fog in the detection field.

## **MAINTENANCE TIPS**

![](_page_1_Picture_12.jpeg)

Avoid condensation. Avoid exposure to

![](_page_1_Picture_14.jpeg)

sudden and extreme temperature changes.

![](_page_1_Picture_16.jpeg)

Keep the sensor permanently powered in environments where the temperature can descend below -10°C.

![](_page_1_Picture_18.jpeg)

When needed, wipe the laser window only with a soft, clean and damp microfibre cloth.

## **SAFETY TIPS**

![](_page_1_Picture_21.jpeg)

Do not use dry or dirty towels or aggressive products to clean the laser window.

![](_page_1_Picture_23.jpeg)

Avoid direct exposure to high pressure cleaning.

![](_page_1_Picture_25.jpeg)

The warranty is invalid if unauthorized repairs are made or attempted by unauthorized personnel.

![](_page_1_Picture_27.jpeg)

The door control unit and the door cover profile must be correctly earthed.

![](_page_1_Picture_29.jpeg)

Only trained and qualified personnel may install and setup the sensor.

![](_page_1_Picture_31.jpeg)

Always test the good functioning of the installation before leaving the premises.

![](_page_1_Picture_33.jpeg)

Do not remove the laser window protection if buiding works are still in progress on site.

![](_page_1_Picture_35.jpeg)

- The device cannot be used for purposes other than its intended use. All other uses cannot be guaranteed by the manufacturer of the sensor.
- The manufacturer of the door system is responsible for carrying out a risk assessment and installing the sensor and the door system in compliance with applicable national and international regulations and standards on door safety.
- The manufacturer of the sensor cannot be held responsible for incorrect installations or inappropriate adjustments of the sensor.

For optimum safety, install 1 module on each door wing side and interconnect them via the master-slave cable.

![](_page_3_Picture_2.jpeg)

![](_page_3_Picture_3.jpeg)

![](_page_3_Picture_5.jpeg)

Slide the base off the sensor module. Take the base and put it on the door frame. The positioning aids help you to align the base correctly.

![](_page_3_Picture_7.jpeg)

Using a pencil, mark the position of the holes to drill into the door frame. You can also use the inner surface of the base to fasten the screws.

![](_page_3_Figure_9.jpeg)

Remove the base and pre-drill the holes where marked.

When mounting the base, make sure the sensor will not hinder the door movement. If the sensor isn't correctly positioned, it could be crushed during the opening of the door.

![](_page_4_Picture_0.jpeg)

Using a wire cutter, remove the positioning aids from the base.

![](_page_4_Picture_2.jpeg)

Fasten the 3 screws using a Pozidrive screwdriver. The base needs to be fixed firmly!

![](_page_4_Picture_4.jpeg)

Drill through the 2 bases and the door using a 10 mm bit in order to pass the master-slave cable. Soften the edges using a sheet of sandpaper.

![](_page_4_Picture_6.jpeg)

Take the master-slave cable and pass it through the hole. Position the cable in the notch of the base and make sure it is firmly fixed.

![](_page_4_Figure_8.jpeg)

Take the sensor and remove the cover: put your finger in the hole and pull firmly towards you in one go.

![](_page_4_Figure_10.jpeg)

Pass the cable through the hole on the back of the sensor and fasten the sensor on the base by sliding it downwards.

![](_page_5_Picture_0.jpeg)

![](_page_5_Picture_2.jpeg)

Connect the black plug to the black connector. Make sure that all wires are safely tucked within the notch to avoid crushing them with the cover.

![](_page_5_Figure_4.jpeg)

Close the sensor which will not be connected to the door controller using a plug.

Sensor connected to other module = SLAVE

![](_page_5_Picture_7.jpeg)

Fasten the lock screw firmly in order to avoid vibrations during the door movement.

![](_page_5_Picture_9.jpeg)

#### 2 **WIRING TO DOOR CONTROLLER**

![](_page_5_Picture_11.jpeg)

Take the flexible tube and determine how long it

![](_page_5_Picture_13.jpeg)

should be in order to reach the door controller. Cut the surplus to avoid undesired detections caused by the flexible tube.

![](_page_6_Picture_0.jpeg)

Pass the power cable through the flexible tube. Connect the white plug to the white connector.

#### Sensor connected to door controller = MASTER

![](_page_6_Picture_3.jpeg)

Take the clamp to fix the flexible tube to the sensor. Fasten the 2 screws firmly in order to avoid pulling out the cable.

![](_page_6_Picture_5.jpeg)

Make a loop with the wires of the power cable and pass them through the notch as indicated. Use the other part of the cable to block the wires.

![](_page_6_Picture_7.jpeg)

Tighten the other side of the flexible tube using the cable cap and pass through the rest of the power cable towards the door controller.

![](_page_6_Figure_9.jpeg)

Cut the power cable to the right length, strip the 8 wires and connect all wires as indicated. The polarity of the power supply is important.

![](_page_6_Picture_11.jpeg)

For compliance with EN 16005 and DIN 18650, the door controller test output must be connected and able to test the sensor.

#### 3 **DIP-SWITCH 1**

Make sure the setting of DIP 1 is correct on all modules according to the door side.

![](_page_7_Figure_2.jpeg)

< 1 sec.

#### 5 **TESTING AND ADJUSTING**

![](_page_8_Picture_1.jpeg)

Check the correct positioning of the safety fields by placing an object in the detection field.

![](_page_8_Picture_3.jpeg)

If necessary, adjust the tilt angle of the laser curtain by turning the tilt angle adjustment screw (from 2° to 10°).

6

After changing the angle, the sensor position or the environment, always launch a teach-in and test the correct positioning of the detection fields.

## **FINAL STEPS**

![](_page_8_Picture_8.jpeg)

Close the cover starting on the narrow side. Do not hesitate to push.

![](_page_8_Figure_10.jpeg)

To open the sensor again, position a screwdriver in the notch and pull upwards until the cover comes loose.

#### ! **SERVICE MODE**

![](_page_8_Picture_14.jpeg)

The service mode deactivates the safety detection during 15 minutes and can be useful during an installation, a mechanical teach-in of the door or maintenance work.

To enter the service mode, push on the button for at least 3 seconds. When the sensor is in service mode, the LED is off. To exit the service mode, push again for at least 3 seconds.

The service mode is deactivated automatically when launching a teach-in.

#### **HOW TO USE THE REMOTE CONTROL**

![](_page_11_Picture_1.jpeg)

After unlocking, the red LED flashes and the sensor can be adjusted by remote control.

If the red LED flashes quickly after unlocking, you need to enter an access code from 1 to 4 digits. If you do not know the access code, **cut and restore the power supply**. During 1 minute, you can access the sensor without introducing any access code.

To end an adjustment session, always lock the sensor.

![](_page_11_Picture_7.jpeg)

It is recommended to use a different access code for each module in order to avoid changing settings on both modules at the same time.

#### **SAVING AN ACCESS CODE**

#### **TROUBLESHOOTING**

![](_page_13_Picture_1.jpeg)

In case of unwanted reactions of the door, verify whether the problem is caused by the sensor or the door controller. To do so, activate the service mode (no safety) and launch a door cycle. If the door cycle is completed successfully, check the sensor. If not, verify the door controller or wiring.
