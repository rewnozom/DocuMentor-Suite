#### *Notes:*

For the camera supports IR, you are required to pay attention to the following precautions to prevent IR reflection:

- Dust or grease on the dome cover will cause IR reflection. Please do not remove
the dome cover film until the installation is finished. If there is dust or grease on the dome cover, clean the dome cover with clean soft cloth and isopropyl alcohol.

- Make certain the installation location does not have reflective surfaces of objects too close to the camera. The IR light from the camera may reflect back into the lens causing reflection.
- The foam ring around the lens must be seated flush against the inner surface of the bubble to isolate the lens from the IR LEDS. Fasten the dome cover to camera body so that the foam ring and the dome cover are attached seamlessly.

### **Connecting the network camera via a router**

#### *Steps:*

- 1. Connect the network camera to the router.
- 2. In the camera, assign a LAN IP address, the subnet mask and the gateway. Refer to Section 2.1.2 for detailed IP address configuration of the network camera.
- 3. In the router, set the PPPoE user name, password and confirm the password.
- 4. Set port mapping. E.g. 80, 8000, and 554 ports. The steps for port mapping vary depending on different routers. Please call the router manufacturer for assistance with port mapping.

*Note:* Refer to Appendix 2 for detailed information about port mapping.

- 5. Apply a domain name from a domain name provider.
- 6. Configure the DDNS settings in the setting interface of the router.
- 7. Visit the camera via the applied domain name.

### **Connecting the network camera via a modem**

### *Purpose:*

This camera supports the PPPoE auto dial-up function. The camera gets a public IP address by ADSL dial-up after the camera is connected to a modem. You need to configure the PPPoE parameters of the network camera. Refer to *Section 6.3.3 Configuring PPPoE Settings* for detailed configuration.

![](_page_23_Figure_2.jpeg)

Figure 2-12 Accessing the Camera with Dynamic IP

*Note:* The obtained IP address is dynamically assigned via PPPoE, so the IP address always changes after rebooting the camera. To solve the inconvenience of the dynamic IP, you need to get a domain name from the DDNS provider (E.g. DynDns.com). Please follow the steps below for normal domain name resolution and private domain name resolution to solve the problem.

- Normal Domain Name Resolution

Figure 6-38 Configure Video Settings

- 2. Select the **Stream Type** of the camera to main stream (normal) or sub-stream. The main stream is usually for recording and live view with good bandwidth, and the sub-stream can be used for live viewing when the bandwidth is limited.
- 3. You can customize the following parameters for the selected main stream or sub-stream.

### **Video Type**:

Select the stream type to video stream, or video & audio composite stream. The audio signal will be recorded only when the **Video Type** is **Video & Audio**.

### **Resolution:**

Select the resolution of the video output.

### **Bitrate Type:**

Select the bitrate type to constant or variable.

### **Video Quality:**

When bitrate type is selected as **Variable**, 6 levels of video quality are selectable.

#### **Frame Rate:**

Set the frame rate. The frame rate describes the frequency at which the video stream is updated and it is measured by frames per second (fps). A higher frame rate is advantageous when there is movement in the video stream, as it maintains image quality throughout.

#### **Max. Bitrate:**

Set the max. bitrate to from 256 to 12288 Kbps. The higher value corresponds to the higher video quality, but the higher bandwidth is required.

#### **Video Encoding:**

If the Stream Type is set to main stream, H.264 and H.265 are selectable, and if the stream type is set to sub stream, H.264, MJPEG, and H.265 are selectable. H.265 is a new encoding technology. Compared with H.264, it reduces the transmission bitrate under the same resolution, frame rate and image quality.

*Note:* Selectable video encoding types may vary according to different camera modes.

#### **H.264+ and H.265+:**

- **• H.264+:** If you set the main stream as the stream type, and H.264 as the video encoding, you can see H.264+ available. H.264+ is an improved compression coding technology based on H.264. By enabling H.264+, users can estimate the HDD consumption by its maximum average bitrate. Compared to H.264, H.264+ reduces storage by up to 50% with the same maximum bitrate in most scenes.
- **• H.265+:** If you set the main stream as the stream type, and H.265 as the video encoding, you can see H.265+ available. H.265+ is an improved compression coding technology based on H.265. By enabling H.265+, users can estimate the HDD consumption by its maximum average bitrate. Compared to H.265, H.265+ reduces storage by up to 50% with the same maximum bitrate in most scenes.

You need to reboot the camera if you want to turn on or turn off the

H.264+/H.265+. If you switch from H.264+ to H.265+ directly, and vice versa, a reboot is not required by the system.

#### *Notes:*

- **•** Upgrade your video player to the latest version if live view or playback does not work properly due to compatibility.
- **•** With H.264+/H.265+ enabled, the parameters such as profile, I frame interval, video quality, and SVC are greyed out if the bitrate type is variable.
- **•** With H.264+/H.265+ enabled, some functions are not supported. For those functions, corresponding interfaces will be hidden.
- **•** H.264+/H.265+ can spontaneously adjust the bitrate distribution according the requirements of the actual scene in order to realize the set maximum average bitrate in the long term. The camera needs at least 24 hours to adapt to a fixed monitoring scene.

#### **Max. Average Bitrate:**

When you set a maximum bitrate, its corresponding recommended maximum average bitrate will be shown in the Max. Average Bitrate box. You can also set the maximum average bitrate manually from 256 Kbps to the value of the set maximum bitrate.

#### **Profile:**

When you set the stream type as main stream, main profile, basic profile, and high profile are selectable; and set the stream type as sub stream, then basic profile and main profile are selectable.

#### **I Frame Interval:**

An I frame is a complete image while other frames only contain the differences from previous frames. I frame interval means the number of frames between two I frames. Bigger I frame interval means less bandwidth requirements in some case, but may also have an adverse affect on image quality.

#### **SVC:**

Scalable Video Coding is an extension of the H.264/AVC standard. Set it as OFF,

ON or Auto according to your actual needs.

### **Smoothing:**

It refers to the smoothness of the stream. The higher value of the smoothing, the better fluency of the stream is, though, the video quality may not be so satisfactory. The lower value of the smoothing, the higher quality of the stream is, though it may appear not fluent.

Figure A.2.2 Set the LAN parameters

- 3. Set the port mapping in the virtual severs of **Forwarding**. By default, camera uses port 80, 8000 and 554. You can change these ports value with web browser or client software.
### *Example:*

When the cameras are connected to the same router, you can configure the ports of a camera as 80, 8000, and 554 with IP address 192.168.1.23, and the ports of another camera as 81, 8001, 555, 8201 with IP 192.168.1.24. Refer to the steps as below:

*Steps:* 

- 1. As the settings mentioned above, map the port 80, 8000, 554 and 8200 for the network camera at 192.168.1.23
- 2. Map the port 81, 8001, 555 and 8201 for the network camera at 192.168.1.24.
- 3. Enable **ALL** or **TCP** protocols.
- 4. Check the **Enable** checkbox and click **Save**.
