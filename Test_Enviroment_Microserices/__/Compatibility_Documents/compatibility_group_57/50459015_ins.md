## Operating principle

![](_page_2_Picture_0.jpeg)

ReX 2 expands the radio communication range of the security system, allowing the installation of Ajax devices at a greater distance away from the hub.

ReX 2 receives hub signals, transmits them to the connected devices, and sends signals from devices to the hub. The hub polls range extender with the frequency of 12 to 300 seconds (depending on the settings, the default value is 36 seconds). ReX 2 range extender polls all connected devices with the same frequency.

## Functionality testing

ReX 2 functionality tests do not begin immediately, but not later than over a single ping period of the hub–detector (36 seconds with the standard settings of the hub). You can change the ping period of devices in the **Jeweller** menu of the hub settings.

### **To run a test, in an Ajax app:**

- **1.** Select the hub if you have several of them or if you are using a PRO app.
- **2.** Go to the **Devices** tab.
- **3.** Select **ReX 2**.
- **4.** Go to **Settings** .
- **5.** Select one of the available tests:
	- Jeweller Signal Strength Test
	- Wings Signal Strength Test
	- Signal Attenuation Test

## Selection of the installation site

When choosing a location, consider 2 main factors:

- **Jeweller Signal Strength.**
- **Wings Signal Strength.**

You should consider the signal strength both between the hub and the range extender and between the range extender and all devices connected to it.

Locate ReX 2 in a place with stable Jeweller and Wings signal strength (2-3 bars in the Ajax app). When choosing a site for installation, consider the distance between the range extender and the hub and any obstacles between the devices hindering the radio signal passage: walls, intermediate floors, or large-size objects located in the room.

> Be sure to check the Jeweller and Wings signal strength at the installation site. If the signal strength is low (a single bar), we cannot guarantee the stable operation of the security system. At the very least, relocate the device as repositioning even by 20 cm can significantly improve the signal reception.

To roughly calculate the signal strength at the place of installation, use our . radio communication range calculator

ReX 2 should be hidden from direct view. This will help reduce the likelihood of sabotage or jamming. Also, keep in mind that the device is intended for indoor installation only.

ReX 2 should be placed between a hub and a device with a weak signal. The range extender does not amplify the radio signal, so if you install it near a hub or device with a signal strength of 1 or 0 bars, this will not give the desired result.

![](_page_18_Figure_5.jpeg)

### **Do not place ReX 2:**

- Outdoors. Doing so may cause the device to malfunction or not work properly.
- Near metal objects or mirrors (for example, in a metal cabinet). They can shield and attenuate the radio signal.
- Inside any premises with the temperature and humidity beyond the range of permissible limits. Doing so may cause the device to malfunction or not work properly.
- Close to radio interference sources: less than 1 meter from the router and power cables. This could result in the loss of connection with the hub or devices connected to the range extender.
- In places with low or unstable signal strength. This could result in the loss of connection with the hub or devices connected to the range extender.

### Installation

![](_page_19_Picture_5.jpeg)

Before installing the range extender, make sure that you have selected the optimal location and that it complies with the requirements of this manual.

When installing and operating the device, follow the general electrical safety rules for using electrical appliances and the requirements of electrical safety regulations.

### **To install ReX 2:**

- **1.** Fix the SmartBracket mounting panel with the bundled screws. When using other fasteners, make sure they do not damage or deform the panel. When attaching, use at least two fixing points. To make the tamper react to attempts to detach the device, be sure to fix the perforated corner of SmartBracket.
![](_page_20_Picture_0.jpeg)

Do not use double-sided adhesive tape for mounting. This can cause the range extender to fall. The device may fail if hit.

- **2.** Connect the power cable to the range extender. Turn on the device.
- **3.** Secure the cable with a plastic retainer plate. This will reduce the likelihood of sabotage as it takes a lot more to tear away a secured cable.

![](_page_20_Picture_4.jpeg)

- **4.** Slide ReX 2 onto the mounting panel. After installation, check the tamper status in the Ajax app and then the quality of the panel fixation. You will receive a notification if an attempt is made to tear the range extender off the surface or remove it from the mounting panel.

**5.** Fix ReX 2 on the SmartBracket panel with bundled screws.

![](_page_21_Picture_1.jpeg)

Do not turn the range extender upside down or sideways when mounting it vertically (for example, on a wall). When properly fixed, the Ajax logo can be read horizontally.

## Maintenance

Check the functionality of ReX 2 regularly. The optimal frequency of checks is once every three months. Clean the body from dust, cobwebs, and other contaminants as they emerge. Use a soft dry cloth that is suitable for equipment care.

Do not use any substances containing alcohol, acetone, gasoline and other active solvents for cleaning the range extender.

If ReX 2 battery becomes faulty and you wish to replace it, use the following guidance:
