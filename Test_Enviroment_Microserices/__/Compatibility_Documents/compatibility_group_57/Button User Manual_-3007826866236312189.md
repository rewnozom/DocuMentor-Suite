An alarm if Button is pressed can also in the Ajax security system. run a scenario

Button can be installed on a flat surface or carried around. To install on a flat surface (for example, under the table), secure the Button with double-sided adhesive tape. To carry the Button on the strap: attach the strap to the Button using the mounting hole in the main body of the Button.

# Control Mode

In the Control mode, the Button has two pressing options: short and long (the button is pressed for more than 3 seconds). These pressings can trigger the execution of an action by one or more automation devices: Relay, WallSwitch, or Socket.

To bind an automation device action to a long or short press of a Button:

- **1.** Open the and go to the Ajax app **Devices** tab.
- **2.** Select **Button** in the list of devices and go to settings by clicking the gear icon .

# Mute Fire Alarm

By pressing the Button, the interconnected fire detectors alarm can be muted (if the corresponding operating mode of the button is selected). The reaction of the system to pressing a button depends on the state of the system:

- **The Interconnected FireProtect Alarms have already propagated** by the first press of the Button, all fire detectors sirens are muted, except for those that registered the alarm. Pressing the button again mutes the remaining detectors.
- **The interconnected alarms delay time lasts** the siren of the triggered FireProtect/FireProtect Plus detector is muted by pressing.

## Placement

Button can be fixed on a surface or carried around.

### How to fix Button

To fix Button on a surface (e. g. under a table), use Holder.

#### **To install the button in the holder:**

- **1.** Choose a location to install the holder.
- **2.** Press the button to test whether the commands can reach the hub. If not, choose another location or use a . radio signal range extender

When connecting Button via radio signal range extender, note that Button does not automatically switch between the radio networks of the radio signal extender and the hub. You can assign Button to another hub or range extender manually in the app.

- **3.** Fix Holder on the surface using the bundled screws or double-sided adhesive tape.
- **4.** Put Button into the holder.

# How to carry around Button

The button is convenient to carry with you thanks to a special hole on its body. It can be worn on the wrist or around the neck, or hung on a key ring.

Button has an IP55 protection rating. This means that the device body is protected from dust and splashes. Tight buttons are recessed into the body and software protection helps to avoid accidental pressing.

# Maintenance

When cleaning the key fob body, use cleaners that are suitable for technical maintenance.

Never use substances containing alcohol, acetone, gasoline and other active solvents to clean the Button.

The pre-installed battery provides up to 5 years of key fob operation in normal use (one press per day). More frequent use may reduce battery life. You can check battery level at any time in the Ajax app.

![](_page_12_Picture_6.jpeg)

Keep new and used batteries away from children. Do not ingest battery, Chemical Burn Hazard.

The pre-installed battery is sensitive to low temperatures and if the key fob is cooled significantly, the battery level indicator in the app may show incorrect values until the key fob becomes warmer.

The battery level value is not updated on a regular basis, but only updates after pressing the button.

When the battery has run down, the user will receive a notification in the Ajax app, and the LED will steadily light up red and go out each time the button is pressed.
